1. Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,"Picture yourself in a boat on a river <br> With tangerine trees and marmalade skies <br> Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly <br> A girl with kaleidoscope eyes <br> Cellophane flowers of yellow and green <br> Towering over your head <br> Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes <br> And she's gone <br> Lucy in the sky with diamonds <br> Lucy in the sky with diamonds <br> Lucy in the sky with diamonds <br> Ah <br> Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain <br> Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies <br> Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers <br> That grow so incredibly high <br> Newspaper taxis appear on the shore <br> Waiting to take you away <br> Climb in the back with your head in the clouds  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> And you're gone <br> Lucy in the sky with diamonds <br> Lucy in the sky with diamonds <br> Lucy in the sky with diamonds <br> Ah <br> Picture yourself on a train in a station <br> With plasticine porters with looking gla** ties <br> Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile <br> The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes <br> Lucy in the sky with diamonds <br> Lucy in the sky with diamonds <br> Lucy in the sky with diamonds <br> Ah <br> Lucy in the sky with diamonds <br> Lucy in the sky with diamonds <br> Lucy in the sky with diamonds <br> Ah <br> Lucy in the sky with diamonds <br> Lucy in the sky with diamonds <br> Lucy in the sky with diamonds"

A Hard Day's Night script,"1. EXTERIOR STREETS OUTSIDE RAILWAY TERMINAL DAY <br> The film opens with crowds of girls, shot in a sequence of CLOSE-UPS, chasing after GEORGE, JOHN and RINGO. The boys hare off just ahead of them. They take a turn down a back alley way and the crowds of screaming girls are after them. <br> 2. EXT. TERMINAL <br> They rush on through the narrow cobbled pa**ageway and into the main station, quickly show their tickets at the barrier for the London train, and get onto the platform as hordes of yelling and screaming girls reach the closed gates. <br> 3. EXT. TERMINAL PLATFORM <br> We see the fans rushing to the few platform ticket machines, and endless pennies being dropped and tickets torn out in their haste to get onto the platform to see the boys. <br> NORM has been waiting for the boys and he hurries them to where all their baggage, instruments and the drums are waiting, piled up to be put into the guards' van. The boys turn and see the oncoming stream of girls pushing through the barriers and descending on them with yells and shouts. They grab their instruments, RINGO makes for the drums. NORM plugs into a handy transformer and using their instruments like a gun volley to stop the onrush of females, the boys blast fire into a number and start to sing. This stops the girls in their tracks and they settle down on whatever they can to listen to them playing. <br> As the boys are playing, we CUT BACK into the crowds. In the centre we see PAUL struggling and pulling to fight his way through the girls to join the other boys. He is dragging a very reluctant old man behind him. The old man seems most disgruntled and we can see by his gestures how unwilling he is to be pulled and pushed forward through all the girls. <br> At last PAUL reaches the other boys. He sits the old man down on a pile of cases and joins in the number to the squeals of delight from the fans. The old man sits aloof and proud ignoring the whole proceedings. JOHN, GEORGE and RINGO look enquiringly at PAUL who gives a noncommittal shrug of the shoulders as if to say, ""it's not my fault"" and the number proceeds. <br> SHOT of sudden horror on JOHN's face. PAUL follows his eye line only to see the old man has doffed his cap and is busily collecting money from a disconcerted crowd. PAUL dives hastily into the crowd, and with suitable apologies extracts the old man and with a long suffering sigh drags him back to the group. GEORGE and PAUL hold him firmly as they finish the number, the old man standing there between them. <br> As the number finishes and the girls scream and shout with delight, the guard blows his whistle. NORM and SHAKE grab the instruments and the drums, and with the rest piles the lot into the guards' van. The BOYS head into their reserved compartment pursued by the fans but the train moves off. They have successfully repelled all extra boarders. <br> THE BOYS stand and wave to the fans until out of sight line ... the girls running along to the end of the platform waving and calling out. <br> 4. INTERIOR RESERVED COMPARTMENT IN THE TRAIN <br> The boys relax, sitting down on one side of the compartment. They are about to settle down and make themselves at home when first RINGO nudges GEORGE who in turn nudges JOHN. Opposite them is sitting the LITTLE OLD MAN. He is holding himself stiff, erect and very aloof. <br> The three boys look at him enquiringly but with an elaborate sniff he looks away from them and out of the window. <br> PAUL catches his eye and winks at the LITTLE OLD MAN. He winks back at PAUL, scowls at the other three then looks firmly out of the window again. <br> The boys turn on PAUL crowding around him. <br> JOHN <br> Eh ... pardon me for asking but who's that little old man? <br> PAUL <br> What little old man? <br> JOHN <br> (pointing) <br> That little old man. <br> PAUL <br> Oh, that one. That's me Grandfather. <br> GEORGE <br> That's not your Grandfather. <br> PAUL <br> It is, y'know. <br> GEORGE <br> But your Grandfather lives in your house. I've seen him. <br> PAUL <br> Oh, that's me other Grandfather, but this one's me Grandfather and all. <br> JOHN <br> How d'you reckon that one out? <br> PAUL <br> Well ... everyone's entitled to two, aren't they, and this is me other one. <br> JOHN <br> (long suffering) <br> Well we know that but what's he doing here? <br> PAUL <br> Well, me mother thought the trip 'ud do him good. <br> RINGO <br> How's that? <br> PAUL <br> Oh ... he's nursing a broken heart. <br> The lads all look intently at the GRANDFATHER. <br> JOHN <br> Aah ... the poor old thing. <br> He leans across to GRANDFATHER. <br> JOHN <br> Eh, Mister... are you nursing a broken heart then? <br> The GRANDFATHER nods soulfully glares at him, in a way that indicates yes. <br> PAUL <br> (whispering) <br> You see, he was going to get married but she threw him over for a butcher. <br> GEORGE <br> A butcher? <br> PAUL <br> Yeah, she was fickle. <br> JOHN <br> Aye and fond of fresh meat and all. <br> PAUL <br> (seriously) <br> No ... it was his sweetbreads. She was dead kinky for sweetbreads. Anyroad, me mother thought it'ud give him a change of scenery, like. <br> JOHN <br> Oh, I see. <br> He inspects GRANDFATHER carefully. <br> JOHN <br> (to PAUL) <br> Eh, he's a nice old man, isn't he? <br> PAUL <br> Oh yeah, he's very clean, y'know. <br> They all agree with PAUL. <br> JOHN has been examining GRANDFATHER. He now leans forward to him. <br> JOHN <br> (in an over-friendly voice) <br> Hello, Grandfather! <br> GRANDFATHER <br> Hello. <br> JOHN <br> (delightedly) <br> He can talk then? <br> PAUL <br> (indignantly) <br> Course he can talk. He's a human being, like. Isn't he? <br> RINGO <br> (grinning) <br> Well ... if he's your Grandfather, who knows? <br> The lads all laugh. <br> JOHN <br> And we're looking after him, are we? <br> GRANDFATHER <br> I'll look after meself. <br> PAUL <br> Aye, that's what I'm afraid of! <br> JOHN <br> He's got you worried, then? <br> PAUL <br> Him, he costs you a fortune in breach-of-promise cases. He's a villain and a right mixer as well. <br> GEORGE <br> (disbelieving) <br> Gerron. <br> PAUL <br> No, straight up. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> The lad's given you the simple truth. I'm cursed wid irresistible charm, I'm too attractive to be let loose. <br> At this moment, SHAKE, a tall man who works with the BOYS, pulls open the door of the compartment. <br> SHAKE <br> You got on all right then? <br> BOYS <br> Hi, Shake. <br> SHAKE <br> We're here. Norm'll be along in a mo' with the tickets. <br> He sees GRANDFATHER. <br> SHAKE <br> Morning! <br> (whispers) <br> Who's that little old man? <br> GEORGE <br> It's Paul's grandfather. <br> SHAKE <br> Oh aye, but I thought ... <br> JOHN <br> (cutting in) <br> No, that's his other one. <br> SHAKE <br> That's all right then. <br> JOHN <br> (displaying Grandfather) <br> Clean though, isn't he? <br> SHAKE <br> Oh yes, he's clean all right. <br> NORM the road manager appears behind SHAKE. <br> NORM <br> Morning, lads. <br> BOYS <br> Morning ... Hi, Norm. <br> NORM <br> (checking them quickly) <br> Well, thank God you're all got here. Now, listen, I've had this marvellous idea ... now just for a change, let's all behave like ordinary responsible citizens. Let's not cause any trouble, pull any strokes or do anything I'm going to be sorry for, especially tomorrow at the television theatre, because ... <br> He looks sharply at JOHN who is polishing his nails. <br> NORM <br> Are you listening to me, Lennon? <br> JOHN <br> (off-hand) <br> You're a swine, isn't he George? <br> GEORGE <br> (disinterested) <br> Yeah ... a swine. <br> NORM <br> (just as indifferent) <br> Thanks... <br> He sees the GRANDFATHER. <br> NORM <br> Eh ... . <br> BOYS IN CHORUS <br> ... Who's that little old man? <br> NORM <br> Well, who is he? <br> RINGO <br> He belongs to Paul. <br> NORM <br> (accepting the situation) <br> Ah well, there you go. Look, I'm going down the diner for a cup of coffee, are you coming? <br> PAUL <br> We'll follow you down. <br> GRANDFATHER rises. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> I want me coffee. <br> NORM <br> He can come with Shake and me if you like. <br> PAUL <br> Well, look after him. I don't want to find you've lost him. <br> NORM <br> Don't be cheeky, I'll bind him to me with promises. Come on, Grandad. <br> GRANDFATHER joins SHAKE and NORM. <br> NORM <br> (over Grandfather's head) <br> He's very clean, isn't he? <br> SHAKE and NORM collect GRANDFATHER and are in the process of leaving the compartment when a fat upper cla** city Englishman, JOHNSON, attempts to enter. There is a bit of confusion and they get tangled up with each other. <br> JOHNSON <br> Make up your minds, will you! <br> At last SHAKE, NORM and GRANDFATHER sort themselves out and JOHNSON enters with his case. The other three go to coffee. <br> JOHNSON puts his case up on the luggage rack, then sits down. All his movements are disgruntled ... he finally picks up his copy of the Financial Times and burying himself behind it, starts to read. After a moment he looks up, notices the compartment window is open. He gets up and without so much as a ""by your leave"" he closes it, glares at the BOYS and sits down again. <br> The boys exchange looks as if to say ... ""Hello, Saucy!!"" <br> PAUL <br> (politely) <br> Do you mind if we have it opened? <br> JOHNSON <br> (briefly) <br> Yes, I do. <br> JOHN <br> Yeah, but there are four of us, like, and we'd like it open, if it's all the same to you, that is. <br> JOHNSON <br> (rudely) <br> Well, it isn't. I travel on this train regularly twice a week, so I suppose I've some rights. <br> RINGO <br> Aye, well, so have we. <br> He disappears behind his paper before the BOYS can say another word. <br> RINGO pulls a face at the raised paper and switches on his portable radio. A pop number is playing. <br> JOHNSON puts down his paper firmly. <br> JOHNSON <br> And we'll have that thing off as well, thank you. <br> RINGO <br> But I ... <br> JOHNSON leans over and switches it off. <br> JOHNSON <br> An elementary knowledge of the Railway Acts would tell you I'm perfectly within my rights. <br> He smiles frostily. <br> PAUL <br> Yeah, but we want to hear it and there's more of us than you. We're a community, like, a majority vote. Up the workers and all that stuff! <br> JOHNSON <br> Then I suggest you take that damned thing into the corridor or some other part of the train where you obviously belong. <br> JOHN <br> (leaning forward to him) <br> Gie's a kiss! <br> PAUL <br> Shurrup! Look, Mister, we've paid for our seats too, you know. <br> JOHNSON <br> I travel on this train regularly, twice a week. <br> JOHN <br> Knock it off, Paul, y' can't win with his sort. After all, it's his train, isn't it, Mister? <br> JOHNSON <br> And don't you take that tone with me, young man! <br> GEORGE <br> But... <br> JOHNSON <br> (accusingly) <br> I fought the war for your sort. <br> RINGO <br> Bet you're sorry you won! <br> JOHNSON <br> I'll call the guard! <br> PAUL <br> Aye ... but what? They don't take kindly to insults you know. Ah, come on, you lot. Let's get a cup of coffee and leave Toby the manger. <br> The boys troop out of the door into the corridor. JOHNSON smiles triumphantly. He is about to settle down to his paper when there is a tap on the corridor window. He looks up and we see pressed against the window a collection of hideous Beatle faces. <br> PAUL <br> Eh, Mister ... can we have our ball back! <br> The man jumps to his feet. <br> 5. INTERIOR OF THE CORRIDOR <br> The boys run away like a pack of school boys and disappear round the corner. <br> 6. INTERIOR OF THE TRAIN CORRIDOR <br> From the P.O.V. of the door leading to the restaurant car. <br> The boys come down the corridor in full flight, laughing away like happy idiots. GEORGE and PAUL pull open the sliding doors. The boys look inside. <br> 7. INTERIOR RESTAURANT CAR <br> From their P.O.V. we see the car is half empty and at a table in the centre SHAKE and NORM and GRANDFATHER are sitting. On the table is a pile of photos of the boys. NORM and SHAKE are arguing. NORM is being very aggressive, much to SHAKE's discomfort. <br> NORM <br> Yeah, you want to watch it. <br> SHAKE <br> (unhappily) <br> It's not my fault. <br> NORM <br> Well, you stick to that story, son. <br> SHAKE <br> I can't help it, I'm just taller than you. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> (To NORM slyly) <br> They always say that. <br> NORM <br> Yeah, well I got me eye on you. <br> SHAKE <br> I'm sorry Norm, but I can't help being taller <br> than you. <br> NORM <br> Well, you don't have to rub me nose in it. I've a good mind to ... <br> (he is about to thump SHAKE.) <br> JOHN <br> (enjoying himself) <br> If you're going to have a barney I'll hold your coats. <br> NORM <br> He started it. <br> SHAKE <br> No, I didn't you did ... <br> GEORGE <br> Well, what happened? <br> SHAKE <br> The old fella wanted these pictures and Norm said he couldn't have 'em, all I said was 'aw go on, be big about it.' <br> PAUL <br> And? <br> NORM <br> Your Grandfather pointed out Shake was always being taller than me just to spite me. <br> PAUL <br> I knew it, he started it, I should have known. <br> NORM <br> Y'what? <br> PAUL <br> You two have never had a quarrel in your life and in two minutes flat he's got you at it. He's a king mixer. Adam and Eve, meet the serpent. Anthony and Cleopatra, there's your asp. Divide and Conquer, that's this one's motto. He hates group unity so he gets everyone at it. <br> The BOYS, i.e., JOHN, GEORGE and RINGO, look at each other then at PAUL. <br> PAUL <br> Aye and we'll have to watch it and all. <br> GEORGE <br> I suggest you just give him the photos and have done with it. <br> NORM <br> You're right. Here you are, old devil. <br> SHAKE and NORM leave. GRANDFATHER grins triumphantly and collects them, then with a sweet smile he turns to PAUL. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> Would you ever sign this one for us, Pauly? <br> PAUL does so automatically but in the middle of signing he gets suspicious. GRANDFATHER smiles at him charmingly so PAUL finishes signing. <br> JOHN <br> Come on let's get this coffee. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> Before you go, I think it's only fair to warn you about me Grandson ... don't let our Paul have his own way all the time, 'cos if you do he won't respect you! <br> JOHN, RINGO and GEORGE take this up straight away. They all pretend to be girls, RINGO jumps into PAUL's arms. <br> GEORGE <br> (coyly) <br> Oh, Paul, you can't have your own way!!! <br> JOHN <br> (invitingly, in a Marlene Dietrich voice) <br> If I let you have your own way, you little rascal, will you respect me? <br> PAUL <br> (choked) <br> I'll murder you, Grandfather! <br> JOHN waltzes PAUL down to an empty table and the lads sit down. <br> GEORGE <br> Eh, look at that talent. <br> They all gaze across the aisle. From their P.O.V. we see two very attractive young girls, RITA and JEAN, having coffee. <br> JOHN <br> Give 'em a pull. <br> PAUL <br> Shall I? <br> GEORGE <br> Aye, but don't rush. None of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff. <br> PAUL <br> Now what's that supposed to mean? <br> GEORGE <br> (grinning) <br> I don't really know, but it sounded distinguished, like, didn't it? <br> JOHN <br> George Harrison, The Scouse of Distinction. <br> We follow PAUL as he crosses over to the two girls. He places a bowler on his head. <br> PAUL <br> (in posh accent) <br> Excuse me, but these young men I'm sitting with wondered if two of us could join you; I'd ask you meself only I'm shy. <br> The two girls giggle together. <br> JOHN and GEORGE are about to move over when GRANDFATHER suddenly appears by their sides. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> (sternly) <br> I'm sorry, miss, but you mustn't fraternise with my prisoners. <br> JEAN <br> Prisoners!! <br> GRANDFATHER <br> Convicts in transit to Wormwood Scrubs. Typical old lags, the lot of 'em. <br> THE BOYS <br> Y'what!!! <br> GRANDFATHER <br> Quiet, you lot, or I'll give you a touch of me truncheon. <br> (He points at Ringo) <br> That little one's the worst. If we don't keep him on tablets he has fits. <br> RINGO <br> (protesting) <br> Now look here!! <br> GRANDFATHER grabs two lumps of sugar from the table and forces them into RINGO'S mouth. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> Get out while you can, ladies, his time's <br> coming round for one of his turns. <br> The frightened girls scurry out of the restaurant car. The boys look in amazement and horror at GRANDFATHER. They are completely flabbergasted. GRANDFATHER smiles at them benignly. <br> 8. INTERIOR OF RAILWAY COMPARTMENT <br> SHAKE and NORM are seated. SHAKE is buried in a science fiction book. <br> NORM looks at his watch, slightly worried. <br> NORM <br> He's been gone a long time. <br> SHAKE <br> (without looking up) <br> Who? <br> NORM <br> Paul's grandfather. <br> SHAKE <br> Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go? <br> NORM <br> Down the ... er ... <br> SHAKE <br> Oh, down the ... er ...? <br> NORM <br> Yeah, down the ... er ... <br> SHAKE <br> Well, give a couple of minutes ... <br> He resumes reading. But NORM goes on worrying. <br> 9. INTERIOR OF ANOTHER RAILWAY COMPARTMENT <br> Grandfather is in full flight of conversation with a charming elderly lady, AUDREY, who is listening intently. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> (proudly) <br> Yes, I'm their manager, I discovered them. <br> LADY AUDREY <br> Did you indeed, Mr. McCartney? <br> GRANDFATHER <br> Now, Audrey, I told you, the name's John. We show biz people are a friendly lot. <br> AUDREY <br> Of course, John. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> Yes, they were playing the queues outside the picture palaces of Liverpool. Scruffy young lads, lacking even the price of a jam roll. Orphans, every Paddy's son of 'em. I saw their potential at once although I had me doubts about the little fella, a savage primitive, that Ringo, but it was him what gave in first. He picked up a brick and heaved it at me and I quelled him wid one fierce flash of me eyes. ""Mister, can you spare us a copper?"" he said. I was disarmed by the grubby little outstretched mauler ... So, I took them under me managerial banner. <br> AUDREY <br> The usual ten per cent? <br> GRANDFATHER <br> Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them? <br> AUDREY <br> (her eyes lighting up) <br> How fascinating. Do go on ... <br> (pause) <br> ... John. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> ... Oh, I'm all heart, Ma'am, all heart ... Well, I let ... <br> 10. INTERIOR CORRIDOR OF TRAIN <br> NORM and SHAKE meet with the BOYS as they are returning from coffee. <br> NORM <br> Eh, have you got Paul's grandfather? <br> JOHN <br> Of course, he's concealed about me person. <br> NORM <br> No ... he's must have slipped off somewhere. <br> PAUL <br> (accusingly) <br> Have you lost him? <br> NORM <br> Don't exaggerate. <br> PAUL <br> You've lost him. <br> SHAKE <br> Put it this way, he's mislaid him. <br> PAUL <br> You can't trust you with anything, Norm, if you've lost him, I'll cripple you. <br> SHAKE <br> He can't be far. <br> JOHN <br> I hope he fell off. <br> PAUL <br> (mildly) <br> Don't be callous. <br> RINGO <br> He doesn't like me, honest, I can tell ... It's 'cos I'm little. <br> GEORGE <br> You've got an inferiority complex, you have. <br> RINGO <br> Yeah, I know, that's why I took up the drums. It's me active compensatory factor. <br> JOHN and PAUL run down the corridor. SHAKE and NORM turn from the door and go in the opposite direction, GEORGE and RINGO follow after the other two boys. <br> 11. INTERIOR CORRIDOR OF TRAIN <br> PAUL and JOHN look into various compartments. CLOSE SHOT of RINGO looking into compartments in the manner of Groucho Marx. In one of the compartments we see from RINGO'S P.O.V. the occupant, a glamorous woman, TANIA, with a small lap dog. <br> She is beautifully and most expensively dressed. She looks up and sees RINGO. <br> RINGO smiles at her and she smiles back. She then beckons him to join her. <br> He looks around to see if she means someone else. She nods a negative. RINGO looks back enquiringly then points at himself as if to say: ""Who, me?"" <br> TANIA smiles enthusiastically. <br> GEORGE has been watching all this. <br> GEORGE <br> Are you going in? <br> RINGO <br> No, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated. <br> GEORGE <br> You never know, you might be lucky this time. <br> RINGO <br> No, I know the psychological pattern and it plays hell with me drum skins. <br> He blows the glamorous lady a kiss, then moves sadly on. <br> 12. INTERIOR FURTHER DOWN THE CORRIDOR <br> PAUL enters a compartment followed by JOHN. The TWO GIRLS, RITA and JEAN, from the restaurant car are sitting there. <br> PAUL <br> Excuse me but have you seen that little old man we were with? <br> The girls jump up, surprised. <br> JOHN <br> We've broken out, oh, the blessed freedom of it all! <br> (he extends his hands as if handcuffed) <br> Eh, have you got a nail file, these handcuffs are k**ing me. I was framed. I was innocent. <br> PAUL <br> Will you stop it! Sorry to disturb you, miss... <br> He starts to drag JOHN after him. <br> JOHN <br> I was innocent. I was framed. I won't go back. <br> JOHN is now by the door; he leers at the girls horribly. <br> JOHN <br> I bet you can guess what I was in for. <br> He cackles like a maniac before disappearing, the door closing after him. <br> A waiter carrying a tray with champagne and gla**es on it pa**es into one of the compartments with the blinds down. <br> PAUL <br> How about that one? <br> He moves towards the compartment. <br> PAUL <br> (to Ringo and George) <br> Did you look in here? <br> GEORGE <br> No. I mean, it's probably a honeymoon couple or a company director or something. <br> PAUL <br> Well, let's broaden our outlook. <br> PAUL opens the door of the compartment. <br> 13. INTERIOR OF COMPARTMENT <br> From the BOYS' P.O.V. we see GRANDFATHER and the elderly lady, AUDREY, sipping champagne and nibbling caviar on toast. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> (looking up) <br> Congratulate me, boys, I'm engaged. <br> PAUL enters and crosses over to him. <br> PAUL <br> Oh no, you're not. You've gone too far this time ... and who's paying for all this? <br> GRANDFATHER <br> It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill. <br> PAUL <br> Oh, well that's all right. <br> (realising) <br> What? <br> AUDREY <br> Young man, kindly moderate your tone when you address my fiance. <br> PAUL <br> I'm sorry, Missus, but the betrothal's off. <br> (He grabs GRANDFATHER by the arm.) <br> I'll refuse me consent, he's over-age! <br> AUDREY grabs GRANDFATHER's other arm and pulls back. <br> AUDREY <br> Leave him alone, after all he's done for you is this the way you repay him? <br> A tug of war now starts between PAUL and AUDREY. <br> PAUL <br> (pulling) <br> Him? he's never done anything for anybody in his life. <br> AUDREY <br> (pulling) <br> You dare to say that when even those ridiculous clothes you are wearing were bought when you forced him to sell out his gilt edged Indomitables!! <br> JOHN and GEORGE jump on the seat egging PAUL and AUDREY on. <br> JOHN <br> Come on, Auntie, you're winning. <br> GEORGE <br> Get in there, Paul, she's weakening. <br> RINGO attempts to interfere. <br> RINGO <br> Look, Missus, this is all a misunderstanding, you see, he's ... <br> AUDREY <br> Keep away from me, you depraved lout, I know all about your terrible past. <br> RINGO <br> Y'what? <br> She hits RINGO with her handbag and continues struggling with PAUL for GRANDFATHER. RINGO grabs her handbag to stop her hitting him. <br> RINGO <br> He's given me a bad character, blackguarding me name to all and sundry. He's got to be stopped. It's not fair. <br> RINGO pushes out into the corridor, forgetting that he is holding the woman's handbag. <br> A voice shouts off from outside. <br> VOICE OFF <br> That's one of them ... stop thief! <br> 14. INTERIOR CORRIDOR <br> From Ringo's P.O.V. we see down to the right the city man, JOHNSON, approaching with a GUARD. RINGO turns the other way to the left when he is joined by [the] three other boys. From their P.O.V. down the corridor we see the two girls, autograph books in hand, followed by ten girls from the same school. <br> Both groups are closing in on the BOYS. There's no escape. <br> RINGO <br> (looking down at the handbag in his hand) <br> Oh Mother!! <br> 15. INTERIOR LUGGAGE VAN <br> Very dark, and behind bars we see GRANDFATHER. He is sitting crouched up on a wooden box tea chest and looks pretty miserable. He turns towards the CAMERA; in the foreground of the SHOT we see PAUL standing. <br> In the background an impa**ive GUARD is reading a paper which he does throughout the scene. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> (bitterly) <br> And to think me own grandson would have let them put me behind bars! <br> PAUL <br> Don't dramatise. <br> The CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see GRANDFATHER in the luggage compartment of the guards' van. In with him are a crate of chickens and a dog. The chickens peck at him; GRANDFATHER moves listlessly away. <br> PAUL <br> Let's face it, you're lucky to be here. If they'd have had their way you'd have been dropped off at Stafford already. <br> GRANDFATHER proudly turns away from PAUL who dodges round so he can still see his face. <br> PAUL <br> Well, you've got to admit you've upset a lot of people. At least I can keep my eye on you while you're stuck in here. <br> GRANDFATHER turns away again. <br> PAUL <br> All right, how about Ringo? I mean ... he's very upset, you know ... and as far as your girlfriend, little Audrey's concerned, she's finished with men for the rest of her natural, and another thing ... <br> GRANDFATHER <br> A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days. <br> PAUL <br> Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to d**h! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things? <br> GRANDFATHER <br> (cutting in) <br> You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul? <br> PAUL <br> Yeah ... so what? <br> GRANDFATHER <br> Why do you always use your left hand? <br> PAUL <br> Well, don't be daft, I've got to. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> And I take a left-handed view of life, I've got to. <br> PAUL grins. After a moment of looking at him, PAUL opens the door of <br> the luggage compartment and joins GRANDFATHER on a box. <br> PAUL <br> Shove up! <br> GRANDFATHER produces a penny. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> Odds or evens? <br> PAUL sighs. <br> PAUL <br> Odds. <br> GRANDFATHER flips the coin. <br> The guards' van door opens and JOHN, GEORGE and RINGO come in, with them are the girls, RITA and JEAN. <br> JOHN <br> (as he sees PAUL behind the bars) <br> Don't worry, son, we'll get you the best lawyer trading stamps can buy. <br> PAUL <br> Oh, it's a laugh a line with Lennon. <br> (to Ringo) <br> Anyroad up ... It's all your fault. <br> RINGO <br> Me? Why? <br> GEORGE <br> Bag-snatcher. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> That's right; convict without trial ... Habeas corpus. <br> JOHN <br> (casually) <br> Every morning. <br> JOHN has been looking around the guards' van. <br> JOHN <br> Gaw, it's depressing in here, isn't it? Funny... <br> (he pats the dog) <br> 'cos they usually reckon dogs more than people in England, don't they? You'd expect something a little more palatial. <br> (he shudders) <br> Come on. Let's have a little action. Let's do something, then. <br> PAUL <br> Like what? <br> JOHN <br> Well, I've got me gob stopper. <br> (he produces his mouth organ.) <br> Look, a genuine Stradivarius, hand tooled at Dagenham. <br> And to RINGO's beat on a tea chest they are off, PAUL and GEORGE improvising other sounds, much to the GIRLS' delight. During the number, GRANDFATHER quietly lets the latch off the chicken crate and chickens begin to wander through the scene. <br> 16. EXTERIOR TRAIN IN MOTION FROM ABOVE (NIGHT) <br> While the number is progressing, the train is getting nearer and nearer to London. <br> 17. EXTERIOR PLATFORM TERMINUS (NIGHT) <br> SHOTS of the station full of GIRLS waiting for the BOYS. <br> 18. INTERIOR GUARDS VAN <br> By the time the number finishes the train pulls up with a sharp halt that sends them all sprawling, BOYS and GIRLS. <br> NORM enters the guards' van. <br> NORM <br> Don't move, any of you. They've gone potty out there. The whole place is surging with girls. <br> JOHN <br> Please, can I have one to surge with? <br> NORM <br> No. <br> JOHN <br> Ah, go on, you swine. <br> NORM <br> No, you can't. Look, as soon as I tell you, run through this door here and into the big car that's waiting. <br> He points and we see a big car parked across the road. <br> The BOYS prepare to depart, lining up with GRANDFATHER at the door. <br> 19. EXTERIOR PLATFORM TERMINUS <br> Just as they are ready to go, a line of taxis draws up parallel to the train and now separates them from the big car waiting for them. <br> NORM <br> Oh no! <br> GRANDFATHER pushes past the BOYS, holding his coat closed. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> All right, lads, follow me. <br> And before NORM can stop him, he darts out of the door, PAUL after him. The fans further down the platform see PAUL and charge forward ... in a panic NORM and the others follow, JOHN just having time to kiss both the girls. <br> JOHN <br> Vive l'amour! <br> NORM drags him away. <br> 20. EXTERIOR RAILWAY STATION <br> The BOYS manage to follow GRANDFATHER by leaping onto a motorized luggage carrier, GEORGE driving and the other three posing as a frozen tableau on the back. GRANDFATHER has arrived at a taxi door. He flings it open and runs through, opening the other door, thus making a safe bridge to the car. <br> The BOYS follow and manage to make it to the big car safely. They run towards grandfather's taxi. The FANS have followed the BOYS and we see streams of GIRLS piling through all the taxis one of which contains JOHNSON the city man, opening and shutting the doors to get through, much to the indignation of the TAXI DRIVERS. <br> 21. INTERIOR BIG CAR <br> NORM is sitting in front with the driver, FRANK. The four BOYS and GRANDFATHER are squashed together in the back. <br> NORM <br> (to the driver) <br> Go like the clappers, son! <br> FRANK <br> (smoothly) <br> That was my entire intention, sir. <br> 22. EXTERIOR STATION <br> The car moves off surrounded by the FANS; from a height we see them converge on the car but it moves forcefully out of the station and off. <br> It moves into the traffic in the main road and the journey to the hotel begins. <br> 23. INTERIOR HOTEL SUITE NIGHT <br> There is a reception room and off it lead rooms that are presumably bedrooms, bathroom, etc. JOHN is lying sprawled out on a settee listening to a transistor radio, demolishing a basket of fruit. PAUL is sitting at an upright piano and GRANDFATHER is mooching about the room. One of the doors opens and GEORGE enters followed by RINGO, none of the BOYS are wearing coats. <br> RINGO <br> I don't snore. <br> GEORGE <br> You do - repeatedly. <br> RINGO <br> (to John) <br> Do I snore? <br> JOHN <br> (eating a banana) <br> You're a window rattler, son. <br> RINGO <br> Well, that's just your opinion. Do I snore, Paul? <br> PAUL <br> (stopping playing) <br> With a trombone hooter like yours it'd be unnatural if you didn't. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> Don't mock the afflicted, Pauly. <br> PAUL <br> Oh for Pete's sake, It's only a joke. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> Well, it may be a joke, but it's his nose. He can't help having a horrible great nose, it's the only one he's got. And his poor little head's trembling under the weight of it. <br> NORM enters with three piles of fan mail and places them in front of JOHN on a table. RINGO is almost in tears, examining his nose in a mirror. <br> NORM <br> Paul, John, George - get at it. <br> JOHN <br> Hello the income tax have caught up with us at last. <br> PAUL and GEORGE gather round the low table. RINGO is left out of it. <br> RINGO <br> None for me, then? <br> NORM <br> Sorry. <br> John hands RINGO a single envelope. <br> JOHN <br> That'll keep you busy. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> It's your nose, y'see. Fans are funny that way. Take a dislike to things. They'll pick on a nose... <br> RINGO <br> You go and pick on your own. <br> SHAKE enters with a stack of mail about three times larger than all the others put together. <br> JOHN <br> Is that yours? <br> SHAKE <br> For Ringo. <br> He dumps it in Ringo's arms who staggers into an armchair. The BOYS send him up. <br> JOHN <br> That must have cost you a fortune in stamps, Ringo. <br> GEORGE <br> He comes from a large family. <br> RINGO <br> (dumping the letters) <br> Well. <br> RINGO opens his letter and reads it. It contains a large embossed card. <br> RINGO <br> Eh, what's Boyd's Club? <br> The lads gather round him and PAUL takes the card from him and reads. <br> PAUL <br> ""The Management of Boyd's takes pleasure in requesting the company of Mr Richard Starkey""--that's you--""in their recently refinished gaming rooms. Chemin de Fer. Baccarat, Roulette, and Champagne Buffet."" Blimey! <br> RINGO <br> (surprised) <br> And they want me? <br> JOHN <br> Oh, it's got round that you're a heavy punter. <br> NORM <br> (snatching the card) <br> Well you're not going. <br> RINGO <br> Ah. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> (taking card from Norm) <br> Quite right, invites to gambling dens full of easy money and fast women, chicken sandwiches and cornets of caviar, disgusting! <br> He pockets the card himself. <br> RINGO <br> That's mine. <br> NORM <br> Have done, and you lot get your pens out. <br> BOYS <br> Why? <br> NORM <br> It's homework time for all you college puddings. I want this lot <br> (he indicates the fan letters) <br> all answered tonight. <br> The BOYS all protest. <br> NORM <br> I'll brook no denial! <br> JOHN <br> It's all right for you, you couldn't get a pen in your foot, you swine. <br> NORM <br> Come on, Shake, we'll leave 'em to their <br> penmanship. <br> He goes followed by SHAKE. <br> There is a pause and JOHN deliberately rises slowly and crosses to his coat. He puts it on and walks to the door. <br> JOHN <br> While the swine's away the piglets can play. Well, come on, what are we waiting for? <br> With a whoop PAUL, GEORGE and RINGO collect their coats and head for the door. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> What about all these letters? <br> BOYS <br> Read 'em! <br> They disappear. After a moment GRANDFATHER takes out Ringo's card. <br> C.U. GRANDFATHER <br> GRANDFATHER <br> And a free champagne buffet. <br> He grins to himself. At this moment a WAITER enters with a tray. He is clad in tails and GRANDFATHER eyes them longingly, measuring himself the while alongside the startled waiter. He leaves us with no doubt in our minds what he wants, i.e., the waiter's suit. <br> 24. INTERIOR DANCING CLUB NIGHT <br> The club is the latest in modern decor and full of teenagers all enjoying themselves. The CAMERA wanders around the club till it finally picks out JOHN, PAUL, GEORGE and RINGO all crowded around one small table. The music is blaring away from a juke box and the BOYS join the dancers. They are recognised and given smiles and nods of encouragement <br> by all the other customers. During this scene we <br> CUT AWAY <br> 25. INTERIOR BOYD'S CLUB NIGHT <br> The whole atmosphere is of quiet elegance and loud wealth. Around the baccarat table the rich, bored customers sit barely moving a face muscle as they languidly murmur ""suivez"" and ""banco"" to the dealer as he operates the shoe. The manager of the club is beaming with satisfaction as he surveys his customers. One of these customers is clad in evening dress and he has his back to us. The rest of the players (male) are in suits. By each of them is standing a lush lady with a bored sophisticated face that looks as if it has been painted on. From the REVERSE of the LAST SHOT we now see the solitary evening dress player is GRANDFATHER. He looks around him and wipes off his look of enjoyment and elaborately out-bores everyone in the room. <br> DEALER <br> Alors, M'sieur? <br> GRANDFATHER <br> (nonchalant) <br> Souflée. <br> He turns to the buxom BLONDE, who is dripping over him. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> I bet you're a great swimmer. My turn? Bingo! <br> CROUPIER <br> Pas ""Bingo,"" M'sieur... Banco. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> (taking) <br> I'll take the little darlings anyway. <br> He takes up the cards and can't understand that they are unnumbered. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> Two and one is three, carry one is four. <br> The buxom BLONDE leans over him. <br> BLONDE <br> Lay them down. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> (disturbed by his eyeline) <br> Eh? <br> BLONDE <br> Lay them down. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> We'd be thrown out. <br> BLONDE <br> Your cards... lay them down... face up. <br> He does so. <br> CROUPIER <br> Huit à la pointe... et sept. <br> (He pushes chips and box to Grandfather.) <br> BLONDE <br> You had a lovely little pair, y'see. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> I did? <br> CROUPIER taps impatiently on box (shoe). <br> BLONDE <br> They're yours. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> They are? <br> BLONDE <br> The cards... you're bank. <br> 26. INTERIOR DANCING CLUB <br> The BOYS are having a rare old time and the place is really moving. <br> 27. INTERIOR BOYD'S CLUB <br> GRANDFATHER is playing and a waiter is checking the requirements of the players. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> Bingo! <br> CROUPIER <br> (wearily) <br> M'lord dit ""Bingo."" <br> WAITER <br> (to Grandfather) <br> A little light refreshment. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> (lordly) <br> A gla** of the old chablis to wash down a gesture of giblets wouldn't go amiss. <br> (He resumes his game.) <br> Souflée, chop chop. <br> The CROUPIER uses the spatula to pick up a card. GRANDFATHER grabs it and scoops some sandwiches off a pa**ing tray. <br> 28. INTERIOR DANCING CLUB <br> The BOYS are at their table again laughing and enjoying themselves, when suddenly their faces freeze. <br> From their P.O.V. we see NORM standing glowering down at them. With him is SHAKE. Reluctantly the BOYS arise and follow NORM out. <br> 29. INTERIOR BOYD'S <br> GRANDFATHER is looking worried at the call of the card he loses and we see that all his chips have gone. He notices the waiter delivering snacks and champagne to a couple, so quick as a flash, he places a handkerchief over his arm and writing a bill out on a piece of paper, presents it to the couple and collects payment in chips. He then resumes playing. <br> 30. INTERIOR HOTEL ROOM <br> Waiter is sitting on chair in underclothes, reading. He hears a noise, says ""The manager!"" and hides in outer clothes closet. NORM and the BOYS enter saying: <br> NORM <br> Now get on with it. <br> JOHN <br> We were going to do it. <br> NORM <br> Aye, well, now! <br> (He goes through bedroom.) <br> RINGO goes to hang up coat in closet. He does so, then crosses to rest. <br> RINGO <br> Any of you lot put a man in that cupboard? <br> ALL <br> A man? No. <br> RINGO <br> Well somebody did. <br> GEORGE goes to cupboard. We see the WAITER from his P.O.V. He closes door, returns to group. <br> GEORGE <br> He's right, y'know. <br> BOYS <br> (disinterested) <br> Ah well, there you go. <br> SHAKE enters front door, goes to hang up coat and drags WAITER out. <br> SHAKE <br> Eh, what's all this? <br> PAUL <br> Oh, him... He's been lurking. <br> JOHN <br> Aye, he looks a right lurker. <br> SHAKE <br> (to WAITER) <br> You're undressed. Where are your clothes? <br> WAITER <br> The old gentlemen borrowed them to go gambling at Boyd's. <br> PAUL <br> No! <br> RINGO <br> Oh, he's gone to my club, has he? <br> PAUL <br> (turning on Ringo) <br> Yeah, It's all your fault, getting invites to gambling clubs. He's probably in the middle of an orgy by now. <br> JOHN <br> Well, what are we waiting for? <br> SHAKE <br> Aye, come on, honest, that grandfather of yours <br> is worse than any of you lot. <br> 31. INTERIOR BOYD'S <br> GRANDFATHER is drinking champagne in locked arms with BLONDE. <br> WAITER <br> Encore de champagne, Monsieur? <br> GRANDFATHER <br> Yes, and I'll have some more champagne as well. <br> He takes another swig of his gla**. <br> MANAGER <br> (beaming) <br> Lord John McCartney, he's the millionaire Irish Peer, filthy rich of course. <br> CUSTOMER <br> Oh I don't know, looks rather clean to me. <br> The MANAGER comes to grandfather's side. <br> MANAGER <br> Play is about to resume, m'lord. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> (handing him a chip) <br> Lead me to it, I've a winning itch that only success can pacify. <br> He takes his place at the table. The MANAGER watches for a moment then moves away from the table towards the club reception desk. <br> 32. INTERIOR RECEPTION DESK BOYD'S CLUB <br> JOHN, PAUL, GEORGE, RINGO, NORM and SHAKE are trying to gain entrance. <br> ATTENDANT <br> I'm sorry sir, members and invited guests only. <br> PAUL, GEORGE, RINGO, JOHN <br> I've got to get in. <br> It's urgent and important. <br> I've had an invite. <br> Take me to your leader. <br> NORM <br> Shurrup. <br> The BOYS do and meanwhile the MANAGER has walked into SHOT. He recognises the BOYS and welcomes them with false enthusiasm. They all start to enter the main room. <br> NORM <br> All we want to know is have you got a little <br> old man in there? <br> MANAGER <br> (pleasantly) <br> Do you mean Lord McCartney? <br> CLOSE-UP PAUL <br> PAUL <br> He's at it again. Look, I'm his grandfather... I mean... <br> BLONDE <br> (standing next to Grandfather) <br> Oh, it must be the dolly floor show. <br> JOHN <br> Stay where you are everybody this is a raid and we want him. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> Who are these ruffians?... I've never seen them before in my life! ... (etc.) <br> They grab the protesting GRANDFATHER and drag him into the reception area. He keeps trying to return to BLONDE and table. GEORGE and RINGO each take an end of the velvet cord hanging between the two stanchions. They exchange ends and re-hook it, thus encircling GRANDFATHER by the <br> entrance desk. They then go to settle up. <br> MANAGER <br> (with false charm) <br> Before you go, gentlemen, there's the small matter of the bill. <br> He snaps his fingers and a waiter hands him the bill. <br> NORM <br> (taking it) <br> I'll settle that. <br> He glances at it. <br> NORM <br> A hundred and eighty pounds! <br> MANAGER <br> (icily) <br> I beg your pardon, guineas. <br> At that moment a WAITER appears with a tray full of pound notes. <br> WAITER <br> Your winnings, my lord, one hundred and ninety <br> pounds. <br> The MANAGER tears up the bill and takes the money. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> How about me change? <br> MANAGER <br> Cloak room charge. <br> He hands GRANDFATHER his old mackintosh. <br> RINGO <br> (brightly) <br> Ah well, easy come, easy go. <br> The others glower at him. <br> RINGO <br> Well. <br> 33. INTERIOR BIG CAR (MOVING ON WAY TO STUDIOS) <br> The BOYS have settled down. <br> JOHN <br> Should I say it? <br> GEORGE <br> Follow your impulse. <br> RINGO <br> It'll only get you into trouble. <br> JOHN <br> (to RINGO) <br> Aah, shurrup, misery! <br> JOHN slouches forward. <br> JOHN <br> (urgently) <br> O.K. Driver, follow that car!! <br> The driver [Frank] is an urbane young man in a handsome grey uniform. <br> FRANK <br> (indicating the traffic) <br> Would you like to be a little more precise, sir? <br> JOHN <br> Well, that's the wrong line for a start. <br> FRANK <br> Sorry? <br> (meaning: ""I beg your pardon."") <br> GEORGE <br> Oh, don't pay any attention to him, he was just fulfilling a lifelong ambition. <br> FRANK <br> I see. <br> JOHN <br> Yeah, you know, ""O.K. Buster, follow that car, there's a sawbuck in it for you if you get real close!"" <br> FRANK <br> Oh, yes, now I'm with you. <br> [he changes his accent] <br> But, gee, Mister, I've got my license to think of ... we're doing a hundred now ... <br> The car is stopped in traffic behind a bus. JOHN gets out of car and walks to the front. JOHN leans in window delightedly, he flashes his wallet. <br> JOHN <br> Ever seen one of these before? <br> FRANK <br> Ah ... a shamus, eh? <br> JOHN <br> I see you go to the night court. <br> FRANK <br> I've made the scene. <br> JOHN <br> Well, remember, its Leathery Magee up ahead in that convertible, so cover me in the stake-out. <br> GEORGE <br> I don't think that bit's right. <br> JOHN <br> What do you expect from an ad lib ... Raymond Chandler? <br> 34. EXTERIOR STREET <br> As the big car overtakes a Company Director's Rolls. JOHN lowers his window and the boys let out an imaginary hail of bullets at the Executive in the back. He reacts violently and starts to shout at them. As he does so, he presses the bu*ton of his window, so that we hear only part of it. But what we do is unpleasant. He immediately presses the bu*ton and the window rises. <br> RINGO and PAUL jump out of the car. RINGO takes two drumsticks from his coat pocket and, using them as banderillas, inserts them with style into the radiator grill (V.O. ""Ole"" from the BOYS). PAUL, then, using his coat as a matador's cloak, does a bu*terfly pa** at the car which <br> has just started up, narrowly missing him, but he keeps in the matador position. <br> 35. INTERIOR CAR <br> NORM <br> Will you all stop it, you're like a gang of school kids. I knew this was going to happen one day. <br> JOHN <br> (as Ringo and Paul climb in) <br> Well, you shouldn't have had bacon for your breakfast, you cannibal. <br> FRANK <br> (to Norm) <br> We're nearly there, sir. <br> JOHN <br> Eh ... don't call him sir, he's got enough delusions of power as it is. <br> CLOSE SHOT of a long suffering NORM. <br> NORM <br> And I was happy in the bakery. I'll never know <br> why I left. <br> 36. EXTERIOR OF AN OLD VICTORIAN MUSIC HALL THEATRE <br> Which has been converted to the T.V. studios. <br> There are a few groups of GIRL FANS standing outside the front of the theatre, but against the kerb of the pavement is a night-watchman's canvas hut and brazier. <br> The car approaches. <br> 37. INTERIOR OF THE CAR <br> NORM <br> Get ready John, open the door and as it draws up, out you go and straight in. <br> JOHN nods and opens the door. The FANS start to swarm 'round them. To escape, the BOYS dash into the night-watchman's canvas hut, pick it up and run with it to the stage door, revealing the night watchman, staring in astonishment. <br> At the door the BOYS put the hut down and enter the theatre. <br> 38. INTERIOR STAGE DOOR ENTRANCE <br> As the BOYS enter, two P.R.O. men in dark suits, stiff white collars <br> and old school ties step forward and smile menacingly. <br> FIRST P.R.O. MAN <br> (menacingly) <br> Press conference, they're waiting for you. <br> NORM <br> (jovially) <br> Give us a couple of shakes to get our breath. <br> FIRST P.R.O. MAN <br> (more menacingly) <br> They're waiting now! <br> And without more ado they grab an arm each and march the protesting NORM towards the stairs that lead to the dress circle. <br> PAUL <br> Eh this lot means it. They're even taking <br> hostages. <br> The BOYS, SHAKE and GRANDFATHER rush after the rapidly disappearing NORM, who by now is half way up the stairs. <br> 39. INTERIOR OF DRESS CIRCLE LOUNGE BALLROOM <br> It is empty except for two barmaids poised ready to serve, standing behind trestle tables full of drinks and sandwiches. The dark suited MEN enter with NORM and close behind them follow GRANDFATHER, SHAKE and the boys. The group arrives at the centre of the lounge and have time to look about and see the food but before they can get to it, from all directions NEWSPAPERMEN and PHOTOGRAPHERS converge upon them.. <br> Now begins an elaborate tug-of-war between various PHOTOGRAPHERS using their flash attachments and REPORTERS to capture a Beatle and in the midst of this running battle a man with a portable recorder is trying to interview them. Together and singly the BOYS are pushed about the room and while this goes on a hard core of NEWSPAPERMEN are busily devouring sandwiches and pouring themselves drinks, to the annoyance of the BARMAIDS. <br> Every time one of the BOYS attempts to get a sandwich or a drink, it is either too late, the plate is empty, or they are intercepted. The single and constant thing we see in the scene is the pushing and pulling, heavy impersonal handling, the boys are just things to be placed like still life in one advantageous position after another. During the scene these individual exchanges take place: <br> SOUND REPORTER <br> What's your philosophy of life? <br> JOHN <br> I'm torn between Zen and I'm all right, Jack. <br> REPORTER <br> Has success changed your life? <br> RINGO <br> Yes. <br> REPORTER <br> Do you like playing the guitar? <br> GEORGE <br> Next to kissing girls it's favourites. <br> PAUL is surrounded by newspapermen. <br> PAUL <br> No, actually, we're just good friends. <br> HIGH SHOT of the press reception and we see the BOYS ease their way out until they get to the curtained entrance to the dress circle; completely unnoticed, they slip through. <br> 40. INTERIOR THEATRE DRESS CIRCLE <br> The BOYS come up the stairs into the Dress Circle proper. GRANDFATHER and SHAKE are sitting there having a picnic of beer and sandwiches. <br> PAUL <br> (ironically) <br> Anything to spare? <br> GRANDFATHER <br> We've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture. <br> GEORGE <br> Sure. <br> (He does so). <br> PAUL <br> Ah well. Eh, look! <br> He points, and from PAUL'S P.O.V. we see on stage, the setting up of the show, scenery and lights, cameras and sound equipment are being put into position by a small army of studio staff. DANCERS and SINGERS are milling about as well. <br> PAUL <br> Let's go and muck in. <br> JOHN <br> Aye, before anyone stops us. <br> They exit to rows of the dress circle and go through the entrance down the narrow stairs to the stalls and on to the stage that is built and extended right into the stalls, which are partly covered up. <br> 41. INTERIOR STAGE <br> Everyone is so busy that they hardly notice the BOYS, who wander about and examine the studio equipment. A load of three drum sets are being brought on stage and a voice shouts out: <br> VOICE <br> Here, what about these electric guitars? <br> SHAKE <br> Where are they? <br> VOICE <br> Back here, mate. <br> SHAKE <br> (going towards the voice) <br> I'm coming. <br> RINGO is busy setting up his drums, and men are setting up the other sets. He drops a stick and the FLOOR MANAGER retrieves it and is about to tap the drum. The FLOOR MANAGER is a languid young man. <br> RINGO <br> Leave them drums alone. <br> FLOOR MANAGER <br> Oh, surely one can have a tiny touch. <br> RINGO <br> If you so much as breathe heavy on them, I'm <br> out on strike. <br> FLOOR MANAGER <br> Aren't you being rather arbitrary? <br> RINGO <br> That's right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches. I don't go round messing about with your ear-phones, do I? <br> FLOOR MANAGER <br> Spoil sport! <br> RINGO <br> Well! <br> RINGO fusses like a mother hen clucking over his drums. The FLOOR MANAGER is furious. <br> GEORGE <br> He's very touchy about those his drums, they loom large in his legend. <br> RINGO gives his drums a defiant crash and JOHN and PAUL stop whatever they are up to and hurry over. <br> PAUL <br> What's up? <br> GEORGE <br> (pointing) <br> He's sulking again. <br> JOHN <br> I'll show him. <br> He picks up a set of drum sticks and bashes back at RINGO, who does a more complicated drum roll. GEORGE now joins in and to PAUL'S encouragement a drum duel starts completely naturally and improvised. During this encounter the work proceeds around them and the guitars are brought on and SHAKE sets them to working order. PAUL first, then JOHN and GEORGE take up their own instruments and out of the drum duel emerges one of their numbers. <br> 42. INTERIOR RAMP <br> As the number finishes a baldheaded man (he is the T.V. director) storms down the ramp that leads from the control box under the dress circle. <br> DIRECTOR <br> (with over-exaggerated calm) <br> All right I'm sorry and let's hear no more about it. If that's your opinion, you're probably right. Look, if you think I'm unsuitable let's have it out in the open, I can't stand these back-stage politics. <br> By the end of this speech he is standing in front of JOHN who takes the scene in his stride. <br> JOHN <br> Aren't you tending to black and white this whole situation? <br> DIRECTOR <br> Well, quite honestly I wasn't expecting ""a musical arranger"" who would question my ability ... picture-wise. <br> JOHN <br> (to the others) <br> I could listen to him for hours. <br> PAUL <br> Heave to, what's all this about a musical arranger? <br> DIRECTOR <br> Mr. McCartney Senior! <br> The BOYS have a giggle at the very idea and at this moment GRANDFATHER appears from behind the DIRECTOR. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> Hey Pauly, they're trying to fob you off wid this musical charlatan but I've given him the test. <br> DIRECTOR <br> (bravely) <br> I'm quite happy to be replaced. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> (indicating the director) <br> He's a typical buck-pa**er. <br> DIRECTOR <br> I won an award. <br> JOHN <br> A likely story. <br> DIRECTOR <br> It's on the wall in my office. <br> At this moment NORM comes on the stage, confident, cigar in mouth and serene. <br> NORM <br> Hello our lot, everyone happy? <br> The BOYS, the DIRECTOR, FLOOR MANAGER and GRANDFATHER turn on him and stare silently. <br> NORM <br> All right, all right. If you don't need this lot, I'll lock 'em up in the dressing room till you do. <br> DIRECTOR <br> Please do, I'll not need them for fifteen minutes. Thank you. <br> He glares at GRANDFATHER who glares right back. The DIRECTOR walks away with the FLOOR MANAGER pacifying him. <br> DIRECTOR <br> Give me a bottle of milk and a packet of <br> Oblivion. Oh, it's a plot, I see it now, it's <br> all a plot. <br> They go left towards the back-stage. <br> NORM <br> (producing key) <br> Now, come on, I've got the key. <br> He leads the lads off right. RINGO is last as he is putting his drum sticks down safely. <br> NORM and the BOYS turn on him. <br> NORM <br> Let's have you. <br> JOHN <br> Come on speedy! <br> PAUL <br> Ringo! <br> GEORGE <br> Wake up! <br> RINGO glares at them and follows quickly. As the BOYS move off after NORM, they pa** the next act waiting for rehearsal. It is an elegant man in full-tail suit meticulously adjusting his cuff-links. Beside him is a free-standing sign reading ""Leslie Jackson and his ten disappearing doves."" The BOYS pa** him and go through the door. GRANDFATHER stops and looks at the performer with respect. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> I can't tell you how much I've enjoyed your act. <br> He slaps the man on the back with happy camaraderie. There is the sound of a dove, a few feathers fall out of the sleeve of the man's coat and he and GRANDFATHER look down at the floor. The man glares at GRANDFATHER, takes out a pen from his pocket, crosses out ""10"" on his sign, and writes ""9"" in its place, puts the pen back in his pocket and starts towards the centre stage putting on a false performer's smile as he does. <br> 43. INTERIOR THEATRE BACK-STAGE CORRIDOR <br> The BOYS move down the narrow stairs, and out of the ground floor dressing rooms stream a steady flow of costumed actors and actresses. They engulf the lads and force them against the wall -- the actors are all making for the stage door. As the actors push past the boys we see the boys' excited faces, their mouths watering for the costumes. JOHN touches the costume on one actor. <br> JOHN <br> (to actor) <br> Gear costume! <br> ACTOR <br> (eyeing him) <br> Swap? <br> NORM <br> Right, first floor and no messing about. <br> NORM, leading the way, goes up the stairs but as they turn the first corner they are confronted by a group of girls, a game of manners starts, ""after you,"" ""No, after you."" NORM who is ahead of the group looks down on them in disgust. <br> NORM <br> Lennon, leave them girls alone or I'll report you. <br> The BOYS let the GIRLS pa** and resume the journey, always surrounded by people. <br> 44. INTERIOR DRESSING ROOM AND CORRIDOR <br> RINGO'S attention is caught by a door. He crosses and opens it, looking out to a fire escape. The others join him and the four boys step through the door and onto the fire escape. <br> 45. EXTERIOR TOP OF FIRE ESCAPE <br> From the BOYS' P.O.V. we see down below into the property yard behind nthe theatre. It is a long narrow yard full of old coaches, motor cars and all the general debris of hundreds of sets from past theatre shows. Through the piles of heaped high junk there are a couple of narrow alleyways. <br> The BOYS scamper down the fire escape. <br> When they reach the bottom of the alleyways, there is a large door. They open it and look through. <br> From their P.O.V. we see a large green field quite empty. The boys step through the doorway into the field. We now see from a HELICOPTER SHOT the four BOYS standing together surrounded by space. <br> It is the first time they have been alone and unconfined all day. <br> They look at each other and grin ... then first GEORGE and PAUL let out a whoop and run towards the centre of the field, after a moment JOHN and RINGO follow them. The BOYS pick up some loose straw and insert it under JOHN'S cap and sleeves, turning him into a scarecrow. <br> The four BOYS dash about madly calling out to one another and generally horsing around. Out of this emerges an imaginary game of soccer and although there is no ball the game is fast and furious. After a few moments the long shadow of a man falls across the gra**. <br> MAN'S VOICE <br> (off) <br> I suppose you know this is private property. <br> The boys freeze. <br> From their P.O.V. we see a big burly middle-aged man glowering at them. The boys exchange rueful glances and, under the big man's eye, mooch back towards the gateway they came in by. JOHN is the last to go through. He turns to the man. <br> JOHN <br> Sorry if we hurt your field, Mister. <br> 46. INTERIOR CORRIDOR BACK-STAGE <br> GRANDFATHER is sneaking down the corridor, a pile of photos under his arm. <br> 47. INTERIOR T.V. THEATRE UNDERNEATH THE STAGE <br> Under the stage the usual set of wooden columns that support the stage with lots of furniture and a single light is on; it is placed by the orchestra's entrance to the orchestra pit. GRANDFATHER comes down the stairs and winds his way through the columns until he finds himself a safe little cubby hole and settles himself under the light. He spreads the signed photos of the BOYS in front of him and, adjusting an old- fashioned pair of gla**es, ball-point pen in hand begins to copy the BOYS' signatures on to the fresh photos, tutting at his failures and chuckling at his successes. After a moment, there is a sound of someone coming down the stairs. GRANDFATHER darts into a dark patch out of sight. <br> The menacing shadows appear on the stairway. <br> NORM (voice off) <br> There's no one here. <br> SHAKE (voice off) <br> This is the only way they could have gone. <br> We now see GRANDFATHER holding himself stiffly in, he is on some sort of raised platform and he fidgets and in doing so he knocks a lever of some sort. Slowly GRANDFATHER ascends out of shot with a light that grows bigger above him. <br> 48. INTERIOR T.V. THEATRE STAGE <br> A rehearsal of the toast scene from a Strauss Operetta. The entire stage is full of SINGERS, gla**es in hand they are singing away at each other but in true opera tradition they are addressing out to the audience. Slowly in-between the leading man and leading woman, who are about to embrace, a stage trap opens and a blinking, surprised, GRANDFATHER appears. Here we INTERCUT to the T.V. Control Room for amazed reaction shots of the DIRECTOR and control room CREW. <br> Back now on the stage the toast song reaches its climax and the leading man and woman rush into each other's arms, GRANDFATHER sandwiched between them. <br> 48A. INTERIOR CORRIDOR AS BOYS PASS THRU ON WAY TO DRESSING ROOM <br> JOHN is behind them. JOHN, BOYS and MILLIE are walking towards each other. <br> MILLIE <br> (as all pa**) <br> Hello. <br> JOHN <br> (stopping... the boys carry on past, not noticing her) <br> Hello. <br> MILLIE <br> Oh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're ... <br> JOHN <br> No, not me. <br> MILLIE <br> (insistently) <br> Oh you are, I know you are. <br> JOHN <br> No, I'm not. <br> MILLIE <br> You are. <br> JOHN <br> I'm not, no. <br> MILLIE <br> Well, you look like him. <br> JOHN <br> Oh do I? You're the first one who ever said that. <br> MILLIE <br> Oh you do, look. <br> JOHN looks at himself in the mirror. <br> JOHN examines himself in the mirror carefully. <br> JOHN <br> My eyes are lighter. <br> MILLIE <br> (agreeing) <br> Oh yes. <br> JOHN <br> And my nose... <br> MILLIE <br> Well, yes your nose is. Very. <br> JOHN <br> Is it? <br> MILLIE <br> I would have said so. <br> JOHN <br> Aye, but you know him well. <br> MILLIE <br> (indignantly) <br> No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance. <br> JOHN <br> (knowingly) <br> That's what you tell me. <br> MILLIE <br> (suspiciously) <br> What have you heard? <br> JOHN <br> (blandly) <br> It's all over the place, everyone knows. <br> MILLIE <br> Is it? Is it really? <br> JOHN <br> Mind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldn't have it. <br> MILLIE <br> I knew I could rely on you. <br> JOHN <br> (modestly) <br> Thanks. <br> MILLIE touches his arm then walks away. After a moment she turns. <br> MILLIE <br> You don't look like him at all. <br> JOHN winks at her and she winks back. <br> 49. INTERIOR DRESSING ROOM <br> NORM and SHAKE enter the room. The BOYS' TAILOR is there waiting for the BOYS. <br> SHAKE <br> Oh they've probably gone to the canteen, cup of tea, like. <br> NORM <br> That's too easy for Lennon. <br> He crosses to door leading to fire escape. <br> NORM <br> (dramatically) <br> He's out there somewhere, causing trouble just to upset me. <br> SHAKE <br> You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind. <br> NORM <br> Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me. <br> SHAKE <br> But John hasn't got any. <br> NORM <br> What? <br> SHAKE <br> Nerves. <br> NORM <br> I know, that's the trouble. <br> He puffs nervously at his cigarette. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> NORM <br> Oh, I've toyed with the idea of a ball and chain but he'd only rattle them at me... and in public and all. Sometimes I think he enjoys seeing me suffer. <br> He hears something. <br> NORM <br> Get behind that door, they're coming. Someone's coming. Quick, hide! <br> The two men hide behind the door. The boys enter the room, as JOHN is last he shuts the door and faces SHAKE and NORM. <br> JOHN <br> What are you doing there? <br> SHAKE <br> Hiding. <br> JOHN <br> I think you're soft or something. <br> NORM <br> We weren't hiding. <br> TAILOR <br> Now? <br> NORM <br> Now. We were trying to catch you redhanded. I thought I told you lot to stay here? <br> RINGO <br> Well ... <br> NORM <br> When I tell you to stay put, stay put. <br> JOHN <br> (down on his knees) <br> Don't cane me, sir, I was led astray. <br> NORM <br> Oh shurrup and come on John. They're waiting <br> for you in the studio. <br> RINGO <br> Oh dear, I feel like doing a bit of work. <br> NORM <br> Good lad, Ringo. <br> PAUL <br> Oh, listen to teacher's pet. <br> GEORGE <br> You crawler. <br> JOHN <br> He's betrayed the cla**. <br> RINGO <br> Oh, leave off!!! <br> JOHN <br> Temper! Temper! <br> RINGO <br> Well ... <br> CLOSE-UP on NORM's long suffering face. <br> NORM <br> Will you all get a move on! They're waiting for <br> you! <br> By this time the TAILOR has his tape stretched between his hands to measure GEORGE's shoulders. But since GEORGE has moved away, he is measuring space. JOHN takes up his scissors and cuts the tape. <br> JOHN <br> I now declare this bridge open. <br> The BOYS run out the door. <br> 50. INTERIOR BACKSTAGE AREA <br> Five beautiful MODELS are standing about in costume. One is knitting a loose wool sweater which is almost completed. There is the sound of a juggling act's music off and a few of the girls are looking off towards the centre stage. At the edge of frame is a collapsible table covered with green baize. On it are three spaced white plates. <br> From the door off stage, above which is a sign ""To Canteen and Production Offices"", GRANDFATHER enters eating a plate of spaghetti on toast. The knitting GIRL sees him and, in mime, asks him to stand still so that she can measure the sweater against him. GRANDFATHER, eager to help, puts his plate of food on the green table between plates two and <br> three. He goes to be measured with the sweater. <br> From the onstage area, a juggler's ASSISTANT (pretty girl) in costume backs up and with the usual theatrical flourishes picks up, without looking, plate number ONE and throws it off screen towards centre stage. There is a drum roll from orchestra. She then throws plate number TWO. We CUT on stage to the JUGGLER now balancing the two spinning plates on two poles, one in each hand. He has another pole in his mouth and nods to his ASSISTANT, asking for the THIRD plate. <br> We CUT BACK to the ASSISTANT who, still not looking, throws plate THREE which is GRANDFATHER's. There is the sound of an orchestra raggedly stopping and all the hangers-on in the scene look off interestedly. <br> We hear the DIRECTOR's voice. <br> DIRECTOR (V.O.) <br> All right, hold it, hold it... O.K. John, wipe him down and we'll carry on with the next act. <br> We <br> CUT TO <br> centre stage. The JUGGLER is as before but the spaghetti is covering his head, having slipped off the third plate. <br> The FLOOR MANAGER is bustling around, trying to help. <br> We CUT BACK to back-stage. GRANDFATHER has finished being measured and goes to the green table where he put his plate down. He picks up the only remaining plate, looks at it, wondering where his food has gone, shrugs and heads back towards the exit door as we hear the DIRECTOR's VOICE. <br> 51. INTERIOR T.V. STUDIO FLOOR <br> CLOSE-UP on the distraught DIRECTOR. <br> DIRECTOR <br> Where are they? I said, where are they? Where are they? <br> FLOOR MANAGER <br> (placating) <br> They're coming, I promise you. <br> DIRECTOR <br> (fiercely) <br> Now look, if they're not here on this floor in thirty seconds there's going to be trouble ... understand me ... trouble!!! <br> Two STAGE HANDS are walking disinterestedly past, they look at the DIRECTOR. <br> 1st STAGE HAND <br> What's he on about, Taff? <br> WELSH STAGE HAND <br> Well ... he's being the director. Of course, he lives in a world of his own, mind. <br> At this moment the boys, NORM, SHAKE and GRANDFATHER appear. The BOYS grab their instruments and prepare to play. <br> JOHN <br> (to the director) <br> Standing about, eh? Some people have it dead easy, don't they? <br> The director is about to blow his top but manages to hold on and mutter to the heavens. <br> DIRECTOR <br> (to himself) <br> Of course, once you're over thirty, you're finished. It's a young man's medium and I just can't take the pace. <br> RINGO <br> Are you as young as that, then? <br> BOYS <br> Shurrup! <br> GRANDFATHER <br> Isn't it always the way? Picking on us little fellas. <br> PAUL <br> (to Shake) <br> Shove the gentleman jockey in the make-up room or something and keep your eye on him, will you? <br> SHAKE <br> I'm an electrician, not a wet nurse, y'know. <br> PAUL <br> (threateningly) <br> I'll set John on you! <br> SHAKE <br> (hastily) <br> Oh, anything you say, Paul. <br> He leads GRANDFATHER away. <br> The BOYS are placed in position, instruments ready. The boom moves in near them. There is a mike hovering just over JOHN'S head. JOHN starts attacking it. <br> DIRECTOR'S VOICE (over Tannoy) <br> Run through the number and try not to jiggle out of your positions. <br> The BOYS start the number, as the stage hands adjust their settings. When they've finished, they stand about spare. <br> 52. INTERIOR T.V. CONTROL ROOM <br> The room is crowded with the usual personnel, P.A., elecs, racks, etc.... make-up supervisor and wardrobe mistress. <br> DIRECTOR <br> That was more or less all right for me. I'll give them one more run through then leave them alone until the dress ... <br> (to make-up woman) <br> Oh how about make-up? <br> MAKE-UP WOMAN <br> Not really, they don't need it any. We'll just powder them off for shine. <br> DIRECTOR <br> Good. Norm, get them along to make-up will you? <br> NORM <br> (rising) <br> Sure. <br> DIRECTOR <br> (looking into the monitor) <br> And hurry, they're not looking too happy. <br> From the director's P.O.V. we see into the monitor. The boys crowding around RINGO. We cut through the monitor into the same position in the studio. <br> 53. INTERIOR T.V. STUDIO FLOOR <br> PAUL <br> (to Ringo) <br> What's the matter with you? You were bashing away like a madman. <br> RINGO <br> (briefly) <br> You were twanging too loud. <br> JOHN <br> How'd you like a dirty great drum roll giving you a clout right in the middle of your solo? <br> GEORGE <br> You're getting out of hand. I don't know what's come over you today. <br> RINGO <br> That's right. It's always me, isn't it? <br> JOHN <br> Since you ask, yes. <br> (he laughs) <br> Aah, come on, Ring, we love you. <br> He puts his arm around Ringo's shoulder. <br> RINGO <br> Well! <br> JOHN <br> He'll get over it. <br> NORM appears down the ramp speaking as he approaches. <br> NORM <br> All right, our lot, make-up. <br> 54. INTERIOR MAKE UP ROOM <br> A smallish room with a line of chairs facing a wall mirror and a long table. Each place is clearly marked and above each mirror a girl's name: Betty, Angela, Deirdre, Jenny. <br> SHAKE and GRANDFATHER are sitting in splendid isolation. They are staring each other out. <br> SHAKE <br> You blinked! <br> GRANDFATHER <br> I never did, you did. <br> The BOYS enter. <br> SHAKE <br> Hello, he's not talking to me. He's having a sulk. <br> GEORGE <br> Well, it must be catching. He's given it to the <br> champ here. <br> He indicates RINGO who ignores him. <br> NORM <br> Stop picking on him. <br> RINGO <br> I don't need you to defend me, y'know, Norm. <br> JOHN <br> Leave him alone, he's got swine fever. <br> NORM <br> Sit down, the lot of you. <br> At this moment several actors come into the room. They are all dressed in the uniform of officers in Wellington's army. Together with the boys they sit down, Beatles and soldiers all mixed up. <br> Now a group of several pretty make-up girls make an entrance and the boys herald their arrival with a chorus of ""aye aye's"" and wolf whistles. JOHN meanwhile has helped himself to a big beard and the other lads are generally messing about with a**orted make-up things. <br> HEAD MAKE UP GIRL <br> Oh, this is impossible! We'll never get you all done in time. <br> ACTOR <br> Well, you'll just have to do us first... It makes no difference to them whether they're made up or not. <br> (sees John with beard) <br> And who's me, then? <br> JOHN <br> (charmingly) <br> My name's Betty... <br> (pointing to the name on the mirror) <br> Do you want a punch up your frogged tunic? <br> NORM fights his way to JOHN. <br> NORM <br> Now listen, John, behave yourself or I'll murder you and, Shake, take that wig off, it suits you. <br> SHAKE has a long blond girl's wig on. With the a**istance of the girls, NORM gets the boys seated into the chairs nearest the door. For some reason RINGO now has a Guardsman's busby wedged down almost over his eyes and is sitting with it under a hair drier, reading a copy of ""Queen"" Magazine. <br> NORM <br> (to Ringo) <br> What do you think are you're up to? <br> RINGO <br> Someone put it on me. <br> JOHN <br> Excuses, that's all we get and you know you fancy yourself in the Coldstreams. <br> The GIRLS now move in and put make up bibs on the BOYS and start to powder them off. <br> JOHN <br> You won't interfere with the basic rugged <br> concept of my personality, will you, girl? <br> PAUL <br> Eh, don't take out me lines. <br> GEORGE <br> Yeah, they give him that ""Je ne sais quoi"" <br> rakish air. <br> The lads laugh with pleasure. <br> RINGO decides to try a little joke. <br> RINGO <br> (indicating the busby he is still <br> wearing) <br> Short back and sides, please. <br> The other look at him with mock disgust. <br> PAUL <br> Behave... <br> JOHN <br> Foreign devil ... <br> GEORGE <br> Control yourself... <br> GRANDFATHER has been watching the powdering process. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> In my considered opinion you're a bunch of sissies. <br> JOHN grabs a powder puff from his girl. <br> JOHN <br> You know you're only jealous! <br> And dabs the old man liberally with the powder much to GRANDFATHER's annoyance. <br> NORM <br> Leave him alone, Lennon, or I'll tell them all the truth about you. <br> JOHN <br> You wouldn't! <br> NORM <br> I would though. <br> NORM goes out. <br> PAUL <br> What's he know? <br> JOHN <br> Nothing, he's trying to brainwash me and give me personality doubts ... oh, he's a swine but a clever swine, mind. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> (impatiently) <br> Lookit, I thought I was supposed to be getting a change of scenery and so far I've seen a train and a room, a car and a room and a room and a room. Well, that's maybe all right for a bunch of powdered gee-gaws like you lot but I'm feeling decidedly strait-jacketed. This is no life for a free-booting agent of my stamp. I'm a frustrated man and that cla** of McCartney is a dangerous McCartney. <br> GIRL <br> (admiringly) <br> What a clean old man. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> (touchingly) <br> You're too young for a fella of my cosmopolitan tastes, so don't press your luck. <br> JOHN <br> He's s**-obsessed, the older generation are leading this country to galloping ruin. <br> NORM returns leaving the door open, the boys hear the sound of music coming from the studio. <br> NORM <br> They're nearly ready for you. They're just finishing the band call. <br> JOHN <br> (jumping from his seat) <br> Gear! Come on, girls, let's have a bit of a dance. <br> JOHN'S GIRL <br> I don't think its allowed. <br> JOHN <br> Well ... it wouldn't be any fun if it was! <br> The BOYS drag the make-up GIRLS out of the room and into the studio. <br> The GIRLS are still trying to finish making the BOYS up. <br> As the BOYS and MAKE-UP GIRLS dance past, we see one of the ""Strauss"" singers combing his long hair straight back. Two STAGE HANDS swing a wind machine past him and his hair is blown straight forward into a Beatle cut. <br> JOHN <br> (pa**ing him) <br> Never. <br> During dance, GEORGE takes off wig and places it on dummy, revealing identical hair underneath. <br> 55. INTERIOR T.V. STUDIO FLOOR <br> The work is still going on and the music is up full blast, the BOYS enter and with the GIRLS [and] they start a wild dance, hippy, shake, zulu, blue beat, the lot. LIONEL and DANCERS are doing their routine on one side of the stage ... it becomes a challenge dance between both groups. JOHN swings his GIRL onto the motorized CAMERA, Western style, and starts to track through the GROUP. GEORGE is on another CAMERA. <br> 56. INTERIOR CONTROL ROOM <br> The whole control room crew are watching the dance on all the monitors. The DIRECTOR is about to stop the boys but his GIRL P.A. glares at him, with a shrug he lets the dance go on. <br> We now cut between the dancers on the monitors and the boys actual dancing down on the studio floor. When the recorded music stops, they grab their instruments and go into a number. <br> So we can watch every aspect of their work and with so many monitors it gives the impression that there are many more boys than just four. <br> When the number finally ends we are back in the studio on the floor. <br> 57. INTERIOR T.V. STUDIO FLOOR <br> DIRECTOR'S VOICE OVER TANNOY <br> Thank you gentlemen, you can break now while we push on with the show. <br> The boys acknowledge this with a quaver of guitar chords and a drum roll. <br> NORM is on them at once. <br> NORM <br> That was great, you've got about an hour but don't leave the theatre. <br> JOHN grabs the arm of a s**y girl dancer. <br> JOHN <br> She's going to show me her stamp collection. <br> PAUL <br> (grabs a showgirl) <br> So's mine. <br> NORM <br> John, I'm talking to you. This final run through is important. Understand? Important. <br> JOHN <br> (like a pig) <br> Oink! Oink! <br> They dash off with the two beauties. <br> GRANDFATHER is hovering in the background with SHAKE. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> I want me cup of tea. <br> NORM <br> Shake. <br> SHAKE <br> I'm adjusting the decibels on the inbalance. <br> NORM <br> Clever. <br> (he turns) <br> George. <br> But GEORGE is disappearing out of the door. <br> NORM turns to RINGO. <br> NORM <br> Look after him. <br> RINGO <br> But... <br> NORM <br> Do I have to raise me voice? <br> RINGO <br> (choked) <br> Oh, all right. Come here, Grandad. <br> And the two of them walk off, Ringo leading. <br> 57A. INTERIOR BACKSTAGE <br> A man, whose act is playing tunes by hitting himself on the head, is swallowing a handful of aspirin tablets. He starts rehearsing his act, which consists of throwing his head back and slapping his cheeks. Next to him, a JUGGLER is practising with four table tennis balls. <br> GRANDFATHER pa**es him and bumps his arm slightly. Only 3 balls come down. There is the sound of coughing off. <br> We <br> CUT TO <br> THE HEAD-PLAYER being patted on the back. The ball drops out of his mouth and bounces slowly on the studio floor. <br> 58. INTERIOR T.V. STUDIO CANTEEN <br> The canteen is about half full of actors many of which are dressed as Nazi soldiers, with mock blood bandages and arm bands. Also there are a sprinkling of T.V. people. At a table sits GRANDFATHER and RINGO. RINGO is deeply engrossed in a book and GRANDFATHER has a near empty cup of tea in front of him. The old man is bored and looks about him slyly. He then looks at Ringo who is innocently occupied, a malicious gleam comes into GRANDFATHER's eye. He decides to have a go at RINGO and sits staring at him. RINGO gradually becomes aware of the stare and shifts uncomfortably then tries to continue reading his book. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> (disgustedly to no one in particular) <br> Will you ever look at him, sitting there wid his hooter scraping away at that book! <br> RINGO <br> Well ... what's the matter with that? <br> GRANDFATHER <br> (taking the book from him) <br> Have you no natural resources of your own? Have they even robbed you of that? <br> RINGO <br> (snatching back his book) <br> You can learn from books. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> Can you now? Aah ... sheeps' heads! You learn more by getting out there and living. <br> RINGO <br> Out where? <br> GRANDFATHER <br> Any old where ... but not our little Richard ... oh no! When you're not thumping them pagan skins, you're tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish! <br> RINGO <br> (defiantly) <br> Books are good! <br> GRANDFATHER <br> (countering) <br> Parading's better! <br> RINGO <br> Parading? <br> GRANDFATHER <br> (marching up and down the canteen) <br> That's it, parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living! <br> RINGO <br> Well, I am living, aren't I? <br> GRANDFATHER <br> You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarra** a sheila wid your cool appraising stare? <br> RINGO <br> Eh ... you're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you? <br> GRANDFATHER <br> At least I've a backlog of memories, but all you've got is that book! <br> RINGO <br> Aaah ... stop picking on me... you're as bad as the rest of them. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> So you are a man after all. <br> RINGO <br> What's that mean? <br> GRANDFATHER <br> Do you think I haven't noticed ... do you think I wasn't aware of the drift? Oh ... you poor unfortunate scuff, they've driven you into books by their cruel, unnatural treatment, exploiting your good nature. <br> RINGO <br> (not too sure) <br> Oh ... I dunno. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> (confidingly) <br> And that lot's never happier than when they're jeering at you ... and where would they be without the steady support of your drum beat, I'd like to know. <br> RINGO <br> Yeah ... that's right. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> And what's it all come to in the end? <br> RINGO <br> (defensively) <br> Yeah ... what's in it for me? <br> GRANDFATHER <br> A book! <br> RINGO <br> Yeah ... a bloomin' book! <br> He throws the book down. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> When you could be out there betraying a rich American widow or sipping palm wine in Tahiti before you're too old like me. A fine neat and trim lad the cla** of you should be helping himself to life's goodies before the sands run out. Being an old age pensioner's a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the Friday queue at the Post Office. <br> RINGO <br> Yeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it? <br> GRANDFATHER <br> (nodding) <br> You're only right. <br> RINGO <br> (nodding back) <br> I'm not wrong. <br> There is a pause, then RINGO rises and crosses to the door. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> Where are you off to? <br> RINGO <br> I'm going parading before it's too late! <br> RINGO leaves and GRANDFATHER laughs at what he has done, then realizes its full meaning and looks worried. <br> 59. INTERIOR CORRIDOR and STAIRWAY <br> RINGO comes along the corridor then down the narrow stairs. Half-way down he comes face to face with GEORGE who is coming up the stairs. <br> GEORGE <br> Eh, Ringo, do you know what happened to me? <br> RINGO <br> (pa**ing him) <br> No. I don't. <br> As he goes round the corner RINGO turns on the surprised GEORGE. <br> RINGO <br> You want to stop being so scornful, it's twisting your face. <br> 60. INTERIOR T.V. THEATRE NEAR STAGE DOORMAN'S OFFICE <br> JOHN and PAUL are chatting up a couple of girls, when they see RINGO approaching they break off the conversation. <br> JOHN <br> Here he is, the middle-aged boy wonder. <br> RINGO looks at JOHN hard. <br> PAUL <br> Eh. I thought you were looking after the old man. <br> RINGO <br> (with simple dignity) <br> Get knotted! <br> PAUL and JOHN gape at him. For good measure Ringo takes a quick photograph of them before he leaves them flabbergasted and walks off into the street. <br> PAUL <br> We've got only half an hour till the final run-through. He can't walk out on us. <br> JOHN <br> Can't he? He's done it, son! <br> GEORGE runs towards them. <br> GEORGE <br> Eh, I don't know if you realise it, but ... <br> PAUL <br> We do. <br> GEORGE <br> Yes. Your grandfather's stirred him up. <br> PAUL <br> He hasn't. <br> GEORGE <br> Yes, he's filled his head with notions seemingly. <br> PAUL <br> The old mixer, come on we'll have to put him right. <br> The three of them go into the street. <br> 61. EXTERIOR T.V. THEATRE STAGE DOOR ENTRANCE <br> The boys look up and down but RINGO has completely disappeared. <br> PAUL <br> We'll split up and search for him, he can't be far. <br> They now all start to go off in the same direction, they pause, there are three roads they can take but each time they begin to move they all go the same way. <br> JOHN <br> It's happened at last, we've become a limited company. <br> GEORGE <br> I'll look in here again. <br> PAUL gives him a push to the left and GEORGE to the right and going straight ahead himself they part and go their separate ways. <br> 62. EXTERIOR STREET <br> RINGO is walking along taking photographs with his camera when some girls recognise him and start to follow him. They quicken their pace and RINGO runs ahead of them. He turns and comes into another street. He sees a second-hand clothes shop with a sign saying ""We Buy Anything"" and enters the shop just before the pursuing girls come round the corner. The girls stand about looking in all directions. After a moment RINGO comes out of the shop. He is wearing a long mackintosh and a natty cap pulled well down. He is ignored by the girls who don't recognise him. Realising this he goes back and ogles one of them. She glares at him. <br> RINGO <br> Hello. <br> GIRL <br> Get out of it, short house! <br> CLOSE-UP on Ringo's secret but happy smile as he walks briskly down the road. <br> 63. EXTERIOR TOW PATH Can*l <br> RINGO kicks at a brick. He kicks stylishly but misses so tries again, misses again, but finally kicks the stone which doesn't budge so he bends down and pulls it out of the ground. It is quite big. Three quarters of it being below the surface. Having got it he now decides to throw it away. As he does so the same POLICEMAN rides past on a bicycle. <br> POLICEMAN <br> Ain't you got no more bleeding sense than to go round chucking bricks about. <br> Before RINGO has time to answer the man has disappeared. <br> RINGO <br> (shouting after him) <br> Southerner! <br> He looks at the can*l water moodily; at this moment a large lorry tyre rolls down the incline and bashes him slap in the back, sprawling him on the path, the tyre on top of him. A small boy appears after the tyre and stands over the prostrate RINGO. <br> BOY <br> Here, mate, that's my hoop, stop playing with it. <br> RINGO <br> Hoop, this isn't a hoop, it's a lethal weapon. Have you got a licence for it? <br> BOY <br> Oh don't be so stroppy! <br> RINGO <br> (getting up) <br> Well! A boy of your age bowling ""hoop"" at people. How old are you anyway? <br> BOY <br> (aggressively) <br> Nine. <br> RINGO <br> Bet you're only eight and a half. <br> BOY <br> (countering swiftly) <br> Eight and two thirds. <br> RINGO <br> Well, there you are and watch it with that hoop. <br> BOY <br> Gerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old. <br> RINGO <br> Shurrup! <br> BOY <br> I bet you're <br> (searching for an age) <br> -- sixteen! <br> RINGO <br> Fifteen and two thirds, actually. <br> BOY <br> Well -- <br> RINGO <br> All right, take your hoop and bowl. <br> He moves off and the BOY follows. <br> BOY <br> Oh you can have it, I'm packing it in -- it depresses me. <br> RINGO <br> Y'what? <br> BOY <br> You heard, it gets on my wick. <br> RINGO <br> Well that's lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren't you at school? <br> BOY <br> I'm a deserter. <br> RINGO <br> (smiling in spite of himself) <br> Are you now? <br> BOY <br> Yeah, I've blown school out. <br> RINGO <br> Just you? <br> BOY <br> No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong. <br> RINGO <br> Ding Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh? <br> BOY <br> Yeah, that's right, they was supposed to come <br> with us but they chickened. <br> RINGO <br> Yeah? And they're your mates are they? <br> BOY <br> (sighing) <br> Yeah. <br> RINGO <br> Not much cop without 'em, is it? <br> BOY <br> (defensively) <br> Oh, it's all right. <br> RINGO <br> (disbelievingly) <br> Yeah? <br> BOY <br> Yeah. <br> RINGO <br> What they like? <br> BOY is glad to have something to talk about. <br> BOY <br> (enthusiastically) <br> Ginger's mad, he says things all the time and Eddy's good at punching and spitting. <br> RINGO <br> How about Ding Dong? <br> BOY <br> He's a big head and he fancies himself with it but you know it's all right 'cos he's one of the gang. <br> RINGO nods his head understandingly and they mooch on together. <br> BOY <br> Why aren't you at work? <br> RINGO <br> I'm a deserter, too. <br> BOY <br> Oh. <br> At this moment a child's voice shouts out ""Charley"" and from RINGO'S P.O.V. we see three kids. RINGO turns to the BOY and looks at them enquiringly. <br> BOY <br> (to Ringo) <br> See you. <br> The BOY runs off to join his mates. As he joins them they punch and scuffle together. They are obviously a gang. RINGO is left alone. <br> 64. INTERIOR CORRIDOR T.V. THEATRE <br> GEORGE comes round the corner, looking for RINGO, then grins and walks past a sign saying ""Canteen and Production Office Opposite."" He comes to the exit door, crosses to a modern building across from the theatre. He enters [the] building. <br> 65. INTERIOR OFFICE <br> It is the reception room that leads to an inner office. Behind a desk sits a smart young woman typing busily as GEORGE enters. He is surprised when he sees the girl; she looks up and speaks to him at once. <br> SECRETARY <br> Oh, there you are! <br> GEORGE <br> Oh, I'm sorry, I must have made a mistake. <br> SECRETARY <br> (tartly) <br> You haven't, you're just late. <br> (She rises and crossing over to him examines him critically.) <br> Oh, yes, he's going to be very pleased with you. <br> GEORGE <br> Is he? <br> SECRETARY <br> Yes, you're quite a feather in the cap. <br> (She crosses to the desk and picks up the inter-office phone.) <br> Hello, I've got one ... oh, I think so ... yes, he can talk ... Well ... I think you ought to see him. <br> (she smiles) <br> Of course, right away. <br> She crosses to the inter-office door. On the door is written SIMON MARSHAL ... she opens it. <br> SECRETARY <br> Well ... come on. <br> GEORGE <br> Sorry. <br> He follows her quickly in. <br> 66. INTERIOR THE INNER OFFICE <br> A large room, part production office with models and sets, drawing board with ground plans, the other part of the room a mixture of Pop and Queen's magazine decor. <br> Behind a large desk sits SIMON MARSHAL, a bland but slightly irritable young man of about thirty-five. He is wearing the ultimate in the current smart set fashion. He is attended by a couple of underlings ADRIAN and TONY and behind him on the wall is a poster of a girl. Across the poster is printed, ""Way Out, your own T.V. Special with Susan Campey. Director, Simon Marshal."" <br> SECRETARY <br> (proudly) <br> Will this do, Simon? <br> SIMON <br> (looking at George) <br> Not bad, dolly, not really bad. <br> (he motions to George) <br> Turn around, chicky baby. <br> GEORGE does so. <br> SIMON <br> Oh yes, a definite poss. He'll look good alongside Susan. <br> (he indicates the girl on the poster) <br> All right, Sunny Jim, this is all going to be quite painless. Don't breathe on me, Adrian. <br> ADRIAN has recognised GEORGE and is trying to stop SIMON. <br> GEORGE <br> Look, I'm terribly sorry but I'm afraid there's been some sort of a misunderstanding. <br> SIMON <br> (sharply) <br> Oh, you can come off it with us. You don't have to do the old adenoidal glottal stop and carry on for our benefit. <br> GEORGE <br> I'm afraid I don't understand. <br> SIMON <br> Oh, my God, he's a natural. <br> SECRETARY (anxiously) <br> Well, I did tell them not to send us any more real ones. <br> SIMON <br> They ought to know by now the phonies are much easier to handle. Still he's a good type. <br> He now speaks to GEORGE in the loud voice that the English reserve for foreigners and village idiots. <br> SIMON <br> We want you to give us your opinion on some clothes for teenagers. <br> GEORGE <br> Oh, by all means, I'd be quite prepared for that eventuality. <br> SIMON <br> Well, not your real opinion, naturally. It'll be written out and you'll learn it. <br> (to secretary) <br> Can he read? <br> GEORGE <br> Of course I can. <br> SIMON <br> I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines? <br> GEORGE <br> I'll have a bash. <br> SIMON <br> Good. Hart, get him whatever it is they drink, a cokearama? <br> GEORGE <br> Ta. <br> SIMON <br> Well, at least he's polite. Tony Show him the shirts, Adrian. <br> A collection of shirts are produced and GEORGE looks at them. While he is doing this SIMON briefs him. <br> SIMON <br> Now, you'll like these. You really ""dig"" them. They're ""fab"" and all the other pimply hyperboles. <br> GEORGE <br> I wouldn't be seen dead in them. They're dead grotty. <br> SIMON <br> Grotty? <br> GEORGE <br> Yeah, grotesque. <br> SIMON <br> (to secretary) <br> Make a note of that word and give it to Susan. I think it's rather touching really. Here's this kid trying to give me his utterly valueless opinion when I know for a fact within four weeks he'll be suffering from a violent inferiority complex and loss of status if he isn't wearing one of these nasty things. Of course they're grotty, you wretched nit, that's why they were designed, but that's what you'll want. <br> GEORGE <br> But I won't. <br> SIMON <br> You can be replaced you know, chicky baby. <br> GEORGE <br> I don't care. <br> SIMON <br> And that pose is out too, Sunny Jim. The new thing is to care pa**ionately, and be right wing. Anyway, you won't meet Susan if you don't cooperate. <br> GEORGE <br> And who's this Susan when she's at home? <br> SIMON <br> (playing his ace) <br> Only Susan Campey, our resident teenager. You'll have to love her. She's your symbol. <br> GEORGE <br> Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong? <br> SIMON <br> I beg your pardon? <br> GEORGE <br> Oh, yes, the lads frequently gather round the T.V. set to watch her for a giggle. Once we even all sat down and wrote these letters saying how gear she was and all that rubbish. <br> SIMON <br> She's a trend setter. It's her profession! <br> GEORGE <br> She's a drag. A well-known drag. We turn the sound down on her and say rude things. <br> SIMON <br> Get him out of here!! <br> GEORGE <br> (genuinely surprised) <br> Have I said something amiss? <br> SIMON <br> Get him out of here. He's knocking the programme's image!! <br> The underlings hustle GEORGE to the door. <br> GEORGE <br> (smiling) <br> Sorry about the shirts. <br> He is ejected through the door. <br> SIMON <br> Get him out. <br> (he stops in mid-shout) <br> You don't think he's a new phenomenon, do you? <br> SECRETARY <br> You mean an early clue to the new direction? <br> SIMON <br> (rummaging in his desk) <br> Where's the calendar? <br> (he finds it) <br> No, he's just a trouble maker. The change isn't due for three weeks. All the same, make a note not to extend Susan's contract. Let's not take any unnecessary chances! <br> 67. EXTERIOR STREET PUB ON THE CORNER <br> The sign on the pub is Liverpool Arms. RINGO is standing looking up at it. He decides to go in and does so. <br> 68. INTERIOR T.V. CONTROL ROOM <br> The atmosphere is tense. GRANDFATHER is standing miserable in front of the DIRECTOR, the criminal confronted by the judge. SHAKE and NORM are flanking him grimly. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> I'm sorry lads, I didn't mean it, honest. <br> DIRECTOR <br> If he says that again, I'll strike him. <br> SHAKE <br> (unconvincingly) <br> They'll be back, they're good lads, they'll be back. <br> DIRECTOR <br> (disgusted) <br> Yes? Well they've got only ten minutes to the final run-through. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> I meant no harm. I was only trying to encourage little Ringo to enjoy himself. <br> NORM <br> (grimly, C.U.) <br> God knows what you've unleashed on the unsuspecting South. It'll be wine, women and song all the way with Ringo once he's got the taste for it. <br> 69. INT. PUB PUBLIC BAR <br> CLOSE-UP on RINGO. He is eating a bone dry sandwich that curls up at the end. He puts it down with disgust. He has a lager gla** in his hand. <br> BARMAID <br> (accusingly) <br> That was fresh this morning. <br> We now see the pub is full of enormous co*kney workmen downing pints. RINGO is very much alone. He moves away from the bar towards a group that is standing together, they've an average height of over six-foot. There is a group at a dart board. Another group is playing bar skittles and a third group is around a pin-ball table. <br> Near the bar is a shove-halfpenny board with two players. There is a caged parrot nearby. <br> BARMAID <br> (to Ringo) <br> That'll be two and nine... <br> RINGO fumbles some change out of his pocket. A few coppers fall from his hand on to the shove-halfpenny board just as the crucial point has been made. The men glare at him. Embarra**ed, he moves away and without looking, places his gla** on the skittles table just as a player swings the string, which hits Ringo's gla**. More embarra**ed, RINGO backs <br> away, unfortunately into the pin-table just as a winning score is about to be reached. He bumps it very slightly, but enough to cause it to TILT. He then moves to the dart board. By this time most of the pub is staring at him. With great style he takes the darts. The first throw goes into a cheese sandwich which a man is pointing in demonstration. The second we see arrive into a pint of bitter and then we see RINGO shoot the third dart and hear the sound of the parrot shouting angrily, off. The BARMAID has had enough. <br> BARMAID <br> Right ... On your way! <br> RINGO <br> Y'what? <br> BARMAID <br> You heard, on your way, troublemaker! <br> Now the centre of attention, RINGO backs out of the pub, followed by every eye in the place, the BARMAID and a few players following him to the door ... <br> 70. EXTERIOR STREET OUTSIDE PUB <br> RINGO comes out and crosses road, watched by the POLICEMAN who is now quite suspicious. <br> 71. EXTERIOR STREET <br> PAUL comes down the street looking about him for RINGO. In the street is an old building, the sort of place that is highly favoured for TV rehearsals. There is a sign on the door, ""TV Rehearsal Room."" As PAUL draws near, a load of actors and extras, etc. are leaving, they are in costume, they are the ones who earlier had been going to a word rehearsal. When PAUL gets near the entrance he decides to go inside. <br> 72. INTERIOR HALL <br> PAUL enters and wanders about. He reaches a door, pushes it open and looks in. He sees a GIRL clad in period costume. She is moving around the room and obviously acting. PAUL watches her for a moment and then decides to go in. <br> 73. INTERIOR REHEARSAL ROOM <br> PAUL goes into the room. The GIRL is in mid-flight. She is very young and lovely and completely engrossed in what she is doing. The room is absolutely empty except for PAUL and herself. She is acting in the manner of an eighteenth-century coquette, or, to be precise, the voice English actresses use when they think they are being true to the costume period ... her youth however makes it all very charming. <br> GIRL <br> If I believed you, sir, I might do those things and walk those ways only to find myself on Problem's Path. But I cannot believe you, and all those urgings serve only as a proof that you will lie and lie again to gain your purpose with me. <br> She dances lightly away from an imaginary lover and as she turns she sees PAUL who is as engrossed in the scene as she was. <br> GIRL <br> (surprised) <br> Oh! <br> PAUL <br> (enthusiastically) <br> Well ... go 'head, do the next bit. <br> GIRL <br> Go away! You've spoilt it. <br> PAUL <br> Oh, sorry I spoke. <br> He makes no attempt to go. He simply continues to look steadily at the girl; then he smiles at her. She is undecided what to do next. <br> GIRL <br> Are you supposed to be here? <br> PAUL <br> I've got you worried, haven't I? <br> GIRL <br> I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute. <br> PAUL <br> D'you know something, ""They"" don't worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... that's all but if it worries you ... well ... <br> GIRL <br> You're from Liverpool, aren't you? <br> PAUL <br> (ironically) <br> How'd you guess? <br> GIRL <br> (seriously) <br> Oh, it's the way you talk. <br> PAUL <br> (innocently) <br> Is it ... is it, really? <br> GIRL <br> (suspiciously) <br> Are you pulling my leg? <br> PAUL <br> (looking her straight in the eye) <br> Something like that. <br> GIRL <br> (unsure) <br> I see. <br> (airily) <br> Do you like the play? <br> PAUL <br> Yeah ... I mean, sure, well, I took it at school but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds different on a girl. <br> (smiles to himself) <br> Yeah, it's gear on a girl. <br> GIRL <br> Gear? <br> PAUL <br> Aye, the big hammer, smashing! <br> GIRL <br> Thank you. <br> PAUL <br> Don't mench ... well, why don't you give us a few more lines, like? <br> GIRL pouts. <br> PAUL <br> You don't half slam the door in people's faces, do you? I mean, what about when you're playing the part, like, hundreds of people'll see you and ... <br> GIRL <br> (cutting in) <br> I'm not ... <br> PAUL <br> Oh, you're the understudy, sort of thing? <br> GIRL <br> No. <br> (aggressively) <br> I'm a walk-on in a fancy dress scene. I just felt like doing those lines. <br> PAUL <br> Oh, I see. You are an actress though, aren't you? <br> GIRL <br> Yes. <br> PAUL <br> Aye, I knew you were. <br> GIRL <br> What's that mean? <br> PAUL <br> Well, the way you were spouting, like .... <br> (he imitates her) <br> ""I don't believe you, sir..."" and all that. Yeah, it was gear. <br> GIRL <br> (dryly) <br> The big hammer? <br> PAUL <br> (smiling) <br> Oh aye, a sledge. <br> GIRL <br> But the way you did it then sounded so phony. <br> PAUL <br> No ... I wouldn't say that ... just like an actress ... you know. <br> He moves and stands about like an actress. <br> GIRL <br> But that's not like a real person at all. <br> PAUL <br> Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they? <br> GIRL <br> They ought to be. <br> PAUL <br> Oh, I don't know, anyroad up, they never are, are they? <br> GIRL <br> (teasingly) <br> What are you? <br> PAUL <br> I'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing. <br> GIRL <br> I bet you don't sound like real people. <br> PAUL <br> We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab. <br> GIRL <br> Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself? <br> PAUL <br> What of? Look, I wouldn't do it unless I was. I'm dead lucky 'cos I get paid for doing something I love doing. <br> He laughs and with a gesture takes in the whole studio <br> PAUL <br> ... all this and a jam bu*ty too!! <br> GIRL <br> I only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in. <br> PAUL <br> Why? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish? <br> GIRL <br> Why selfish? <br> PAUL <br> Well, you've got to have people to taste your treacle toffee. <br> She looks at him in surprise. <br> PAUL <br> No, hang on, I've not gone daft. You see, when I was little me mother let me make some treacle toffee one time in our back scullery. When I'd done she said to me, ""Go and give some to the other kids."" So, I said I would but I thought to meself, ""She must think I'm soft."" Anyroad, I was eating away there but I wanted somebody else to know how good it was so in the end I wound up giving it all away ... but I didn't nmind, mind, 'cos I'd made the stuff in the first place. Well ... that's why you need other people... an audience ... to taste your treacle toffee, like. Eh ... does that sound as thickheaded to you as it does to me? <br> GIRL <br> Not really but I'm probably not a toffee maker. How would you do those lines of mine? <br> PAUL <br> Well, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, isn't she? <br> GIRL <br> Is she? <br> PAUL <br> Of course ... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber ... <br> (Paul starts acting a Liverpool girl, he minces about then turns, extending his leg) <br> Eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it ... Y'what? ... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. You're just after me body and y'can't have it ... so there!! <br> GIRL <br> (shattered) <br> And you honestly think that's what she meant? <br> PAUL <br> Oh, definitely, it sticks out a mile, she's trying to get him to marry her but he doesn't want ... well ... I don't reckon any fella's ever wanted to get married. But girls are like that, clever and cunning. You've got to laugh. <br> He laughs. <br> GIRL <br> Well, it's nice to know you think we're clever. <br> PAUL <br> (grinning) <br> And cunning. <br> GIRL <br> And what do you do about it? <br> PAUL <br> Me? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm always running about with the lads ... no, we don't have the time. <br> GIRL <br> Pity. <br> PAUL <br> (not noticing the invitation) <br> Aye, it is but as long as you get by, it's all right, you know ... bash on, happy valley's when they let you stop. Anyroad, I'd better get back. <br> GIRL <br> Yes. <br> PAUL <br> (going) <br> See you. <br> GIRL <br> Of course. <br> PAUL stands at the doorway, shrugs then goes out. <br> 74. EXTERIOR STREET <br> In the street, workmen are collecting shovels, drinking tea and doing all the things people do around building sites. RINGO mooches around. In the road is a hole with a diameter of about 3 feet, and at least 6 feet deep. RINGO looks down and a man is busily working at the bottom of the hole. He glares at RINGO. After a moment RINGO turns away. We now see a very elegant young lady coming towards RINGO. She is daintily avoiding a series of puddles. RINGO has an idea and does a Sir Walter Raleigh with his large Mac spreading it over one of the puddles. The girl walks across it smiling graciously. RINGO proceeds with the coat to the next puddle and to the next backing gradually towards the hole. At last he spreads the coat, without noticing what he is doing, over the hole. The girl steps onto the coat and disappears sharply. RINGO looks down the hole where the girl is held in the workman's arms. The workman rises out of the manhole until he is waist height. At this point an elegantly dressed gentleman appears (the girl's husband) he looks at his wife in the workman's arms and hits the workman. RINGO backs away through the puddles, and is nicked by the POLICEMAN. <br> [Scenes 75 and 76 deleted in revision.] <br> 77. INTERIOR T.V. THEATRE NEAR STAGE DOOR <br> The DIRECTOR is pacing up and down the corridor. NORM is also walking up and down, SHAKE is leaning against the wall quite unconcerned. NORM gives SHAKE a push. <br> NORM <br> Worry, will you! <br> SHAKE adjusts his features to a worrying expression. <br> DIRECTOR <br> (bitterly) <br> Well, that's it, two minutes to the final run-through... they're bound to miss it... <br> NORM <br> I'll murder that Lennon. <br> DIRECTOR <br> But I suppose we can survive a missed run-through as long... <br> SHAKE <br> ... as they head up for the show. Oh yes, well I mean it'ud be a pity to miss the show, wouldn't it like. <br> NORM <br> Shurrup, cheerful. <br> The horrible prospect hits the DIRECTOR. <br> DIRECTOR <br> You don't think... <br> NORM <br> (rea**uring him) <br> They'll be here. <br> DIRECTOR <br> Oh now, they can't do that to me. <br> (turning on Norm) <br> It's all your fault. <br> (overriding Norm) <br> Oh yes it is and if they don't turn up I wouldn't be in your shoes for all the... <br> SHAKE <br> (helping out) <br> ... tea in China. Oh you're right, neither would I. <br> He steps away from NORM and stands near the DIRECTOR. <br> NORM <br> Traitor! <br> SHAKE nods his agreement to this a**essment of his character. <br> SHAKE <br> Of course. <br> At this moment JOHN, GEORGE and PAUL enter from the stage door. They are completely unconcerned and walk past the DIRECTOR, SHAKE and NORM. <br> JOHN <br> (as he pa**es by) <br> Hi Norm! <br> NORM <br> (preoccupied) <br> Hi, our lot! <br> The BOYS walk on when after a moment NORM snaps to. <br> NORM <br> Our lot! <br> GEORGE <br> (mildly) <br> Did you want something. <br> NORM <br> (beaming with delight) <br> I could eat the lot of you. <br> JOHN <br> You'd look gear with an apple in your gob. <br> DIRECTOR <br> (accusingly) <br> Do you realise you could have missed the final run-through? <br> GEORGE <br> Sorry. <br> SHAKE <br> Eh, there's only three of them. <br> PAUL <br> Aye, we were looking for Ringo. But we realised he must have come back. <br> DIRECTOR <br> Do you realise we are on the air, live, in front of an audience, in forty-five minutes and you're one short. <br> JOHN <br> Control yourself or you'll spurt. He's bound to be somewhere. <br> NORM <br> Aye, let's try the dressing room. <br> Everyone starts along the pa**age. NORM and PAUL last. <br> PAUL <br> Eh, where's my grandfather? <br> NORM <br> Don't worry about him. He can look after himself. <br> PAUL <br> Aye, I suppose so. <br> They run after the others. <br> 78. EXTERIOR T.V. THEATRE CLOSE-UP <br> GRANDFATHER <br> Here they are, personally signed and handwritten by your own sweet boys. The chance of a lifetime. Be the envy of your less fortunate sisters! <br> The CAMERA PULLS back and we see GRANDFATHER is surrounded by girls who have broken from the queue and are doing a brisk trade with the old man. He has a large sign on which is written: ""Get your genuine autographed Beatles photographs."" On the edge of the crowd two POLICEMEN are trying to force the girls back into the queue. Finally they wade through the girls and confront GRANDFATHER. They look at the old man quizzically; he stares back coldly. They indicate he should hop it and quick but GRANDFATHER defiantly glares back at them. So with a sigh, they grab an arm each and escort the old man off. <br> 79. INTERIOR POLICE STATION <br> It is the reception desk and behind it is the DESK SERGEANT. After a moment RINGO is dragged in by the POLICEMAN we saw him with before. <br> RINGO <br> Look, I'm Ringo Starr... I've got a show to do in a few minutes you've got to let me go... I'm Ringo... <br> POLICEMAN <br> Sure, they all say that these days ... Anyway ... I don't care who you are... you can save that for the stipendary. Here you are, Sarge. <br> SERGEANT <br> What is he? <br> POLICEMAN <br> (reeling off the list) <br> I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it. <br> SERGEANT <br> Oh, a little savage, is he? <br> POLICEMAN <br> A proper Aborigine. <br> RINGO <br> (on his dignity) <br> I demand to see me solicitor. <br> SERGEANT <br> What's his name? <br> RINGO <br> Oh, well if you're going to get technical -- <br> At that moment there is a loud series of noises off camera, furious shouting and dull crashes of wood. <br> SERGEANT <br> Hello, it's going to be one of those nights, is it? <br> (to policeman) <br> Sit Charley Peace down over there. <br> The POLICEMAN takes RINGO to a bench and sits him down as GRANDFATHER and the two POLICEMEN who were with him enter. The sign is tattered and is being lugged after them. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> Well, you got me here so do your worst but I'll take one of you with me. <br> (kicks the nearest policeman) <br> Oh, I know your game, get me in the tiled room and out come the rubber hoses but I'll defy you still. <br> SERGEANT <br> Is there a fire, then? <br> GRANDFATHER leans across the desk and hisses at the SERGEANT. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> You ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated British kisser. <br> SERGEANT <br> Eh? <br> GRANDFATHER <br> I'll go on a hunger strike. I know your caper. The kidney punch and the rabbit-clout. The third degree and the size twelve boot ankle-tap. <br> SERGEANT <br> What's he on about? <br> GRANDFATHER <br> (squaring up) <br> I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again. <br> SERGEANT <br> (to policemen) <br> Get Lloyd George over there with that mechanic in the cloth cap while I sort this lot out. <br> The POLICEMEN hurtle GRANDFATHER firmly but gently over to the bench on which RINGO is sitting and then return to the desk for a whispered conference with the SERGEANT. Meanwhile in full conspiratorial fashion GRANDFATHER talks to RINGO out of the side of his mouth. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> Ringo, me old scout, they grabbed yer leg for the iron too, did they? <br> RINGO <br> Well I'm not exactly a voluntary patient. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> Shush! Have they roughed you up yet? <br> RINGO <br> What? <br> GRANDFATHER <br> (whispering) <br> Keep your voice down, this lot'll paste you, just for the exercise. Oh they're a desperate crew of drippings and they've fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you. <br> RINGO <br> (disturbed) <br> Have they? <br> GRANDFATHER <br> That sergeant's a body-blow veteran if ever I measured one. One of us has got to escape. I'll get the boys. Hold on son, I'll be back for you. <br> RINGO <br> (horrified) <br> Me! <br> GRANDFATHER <br> And if they get you on the floor watch out for your brisket. <br> RINGO <br> (hopefully) <br> Oh, they seem all right to me. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> That's what they want you to think. All coppers are villains. <br> SERGEANT <br> (calling) <br> Would you two like a cup of tea? <br> GRANDFATHER <br> You see, sly villains. <br> RINGO <br> (miserable) <br> No thanks, Mr. Sergeant, sir. <br> We now have a CLOSE SHOT of POLICEMEN around the sergeant's desk. <br> SERGEANT <br> So you just brought the old chap out of the crowd for his own good. <br> POLICEMAN <br> Yeah, but he insisted on us bringing him to the station. <br> SERGEANT <br> Well, he can't stop here. <br> Shot of GRANDFATHER watching POLICEMEN intently and muttering words as he does. <br> RINGO <br> What are you doing? <br> GRANDFATHER <br> Lip reading. <br> RINGO <br> What are they saying? <br> GRANDFATHER <br> Nothing good. <br> The POLICEMEN make a move towards GRANDFATHER and RINGO. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> Well son, it's now or never. <br> He jumps to his feet and scurries towards the door. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> All right, you paid a**a**ins. Johnny McCartney'll give you a run for your threepence ha'penny. <br> He dashes out of the door followed by the POLICEMAN who has his pile of photos. <br> SERGEANT <br> Now, what's he up to? <br> RINGO <br> He's allergic to Bobbies, especially English Bobbies. <br> The POLICEMAN with the photos returns. <br> POLICEMAN <br> (Irish accent) <br> Your man disappeared like a leveret over a hill. <br> RINGO <br> Turncoat! <br> The POLICEMEN turn on RINGO and walk towards him. <br> CLOSE-UP RINGO <br> RINGO <br> Mother! <br> 80. EXTERIOR STREET <br> GRANDFATHER is running at top speed down the street. He is breathing heavily and runs as if pursued by the hounds of hell. The street however is entirely empty and no one is even in sight. As he reaches the top of the street he pauses and turning, looks around him. From his P.O.V. we see just how empty the street is and heaving a sigh of relief GRANDFATHER cackles to himself. His triumph is short lived. At this precise moment down the street comes a parade of police vehicles, a Black Maria, an escorting police motor bike patrol and an ordinary squad car. The procession draws up and the street is full of policemen getting out of the Black Maria and squad car and off motor bikes. <br> CLOSE-UP GRANDFATHER's horrified face. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> Be God, they've called up reinforcements, the dragnet's out! <br> He dashes off wildly in the general direction of the theatre. He has been completely unnoticed by the policemen who are lining up for a last minute inspection by the inspector in charge. The inspector is like a commander-in-chief of a spear-head attack force. <br> They smartly march off in the direction taken by GRANDFATHER. <br> 81. INTERIOR T.V. THEATRE CONTROL ROOM <br> DIRECTOR <br> (watching the clock) <br> Only half an hour and you're on! <br> GEORGE <br> Can I say something? <br> The director clutches at any straw. <br> DIRECTOR <br> (hopefully) <br> Yes, anything. <br> GEORGE <br> (earnestly) <br> It's highly unlikely we'll be on... I mean the law of averages are against you and it seems that, etc., etc.... <br> But his speech is drowned by the pitiful moans of the DIRECTOR. <br> 82. EXTERIOR T.V. THEATRE STAGE DOOR <br> The four little boys from the can*l are being driven away by the <br> security guard. <br> GUARD <br> (going back into theatre) <br> I'll have the hides off of you lot. <br> The kids retreat as GRANDFATHER pants into shot, ignoring the kids he enters the stage door but in a second he is out again, grasped firmly by the collar by the security guard. <br> GUARD <br> You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Go home! <br> GRANDFATHER <br> I must see Pauly. <br> GUARD <br> Go home then and see him on the telly. <br> The GUARD re-enters the stage door. <br> GRANDFATHER looks around him and sees the four kids. He hustles over and after a whispered conference we hear his offer. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> Can you fix him for me? <br> BOYS <br> Yeah. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> Sixpence. <br> BOY <br> Each? <br> GRANDFATHER is about to argue. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> Oh, all right. <br> BOY <br> And in advance. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> (disgusted) <br> Mercenary! <br> But he hands over the money. The kids rush in the stage door and after a moment the furious GUARD chases them out and down the alley. GRANDFATHER, chuckling, nips in the door. <br> 83. INTERIOR T.V. CONTROL ROOM ON STAGE <br> GRANDFATHER is being chased by several studio attendants; he is dodging behind equipment. He finally gets on a sound boom trolley and uses it as a weapon to keep his pursuers at bay. <br> 84. INTERIOR T.V. CONTROL ROOM <br> The DIRECTOR, BOYS, and NORM and SHAKE see GRANDFATHER on the monitors. They dash out of the room and on to the stage. <br> DIRECTOR <br> (shouting) <br> It's all right, leave him alone. <br> PAUL <br> Grandad, where's Ringo? <br> GRANDFATHER <br> The police have the poor unfortunate lad in the Bridewell. <br> BOYS <br> The police station. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> He'll be pulp by now. <br> JOHN <br> What are we waiting for? <br> GEORGE <br> Come here. <br> PAUL, JOHN and GEORGE rush off. <br> CLOSE-UP DIRECTOR <br> DIRECTOR <br> We've only got twenty minutes. <br> 85. EXTERIOR STREET OUTSIDE POLICE STATION <br> PAUL, JOHN and GEORGE come running down the street in single file, their knees high in the air, they skid to a halt at the police station and without pausing they dash inside. After a moment they reappear -- only this time RINGO is behind them. They dash off down the street. They are followed at once by ten POLICEMEN also in single file. They are also pounding along knees high in the air. The BOYS and the coppers disappear around the corner. At once, they reappear from the other direction, then run down the street still followed by the policemen. When they reach the police station another group of police bars their way so they are forced to run up the stairs and inside. <br> 86. INTERIOR POLICE STATION <br> The DESK SERGEANT is standing behind his desk looking very surprised. At this moment the boys run in and stand panting in front of the desk. Before the SERGEANT can start speaking the pursuing POLICEMEN arrive. They, too, are out of breath. <br> SERGEANT <br> What is all this? <br> JOHN <br> (heaving and panting) <br> Hold on until we get our breath. <br> The BOYS and POLICEMEN pant on until JOHN seems to have recovered. <br> SERGEANT <br> All right now? <br> JOHN <br> Sure. <br> (to boys) <br> Ready? <br> The BOYS nod and without further ado they turn and run through the surprised rank of POLICEMEN and out into the street. <br> 87. EXTERIOR STREET <br> THE CHASE CARRIES ON. <br> Shots of BOYS being pursued (still in single file) by police, including the sergeant with one shot where the BOYS are chasing the POLICEMEN. Finally, as they approach the theatre, they are seen by the girl fans who swarm around the police, over running them. The boys grin to each other and are about to make off when from their P.O.V. we see the INSPECTOR and POLICEMEN blocking it. <br> JOHN <br> Ah well, it was worth a try. <br> INSPECTOR <br> (calling to Sergeant) <br> What do you think you're up to? <br> SERGEANT <br> Arrest those boys, sir. <br> INSPECTOR <br> That's all we need to start a real riot! <br> (to Boys) <br> Come on lads, they're waiting for you. <br> ### INTERIOR THEATRE BACKSTAGE <br> The Inspector now hustles the BOYS through the crowds and in through the main entrance of the theatre where SHAKE and NORM are waiting. NORM looks suspiciously at RINGO who is still wearing his cap. RINGO whips it off and NORM delightedly hugs him. The BOYS dash through the stalls entrance and on stage. The DIRECTOR sees them and bursts into tears with relief. NORM hustles the lads into the wings to be changed into their show costumes. All around them last-minute preparations are going on. <br> DIRECTOR <br> Boys, you don't know what this means to me. If you hadn't come back it would have been the epilogue or the news in Welsh for life. <br> NORM <br> Aren't you supposed to be in that box? <br> The DIRECTOR gives NORM a final glare and dashes off. <br> PAUL <br> And another thing, where's that old mixer? <br> GRANDFATHER <br> Here, Pauly. <br> And sitting on a box sadly chastened sits GRANDFATHER. <br> PAUL <br> Well, I got a few things to say to you, two-faced John McCartney. <br> JOHN <br> Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old. <br> PAUL <br> (hotly) <br> What's old got to do with it? <br> JOHN <br> You needn't bother. <br> PAUL <br> Y'what? <br> JOHN <br> Practising to be thick-headed, you're there already. <br> PAUL <br> Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker! <br> JOHN <br> That's right, but he's only asking us to pay attention to him, aren't you? <br> From JOHN's P.O.V. we see GRANDFATHER. He looks what he is, a tired old man. <br> JOHN <br> You see. <br> (to Grandad) <br> You know your trouble -- you should have gone West to America. You'd have wound up a Senior Citizen of Boston. As it is you took the wrong turning and what happened, you're a lonely old man from Liverpool. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> (fighting back) <br> But I'm clean. <br> The BOYS giggle and slap him on the back. <br> 88. INTERIOR TV THEATRE AUDITORIUM <br> We see the audience of girls streaming in and settling down in their places for the show. There is the usual business of getting the show ready and we see SHOTS of the girls' faces, then JOHN, PAUL, RINGO and GEORGE looking at them. At last on cue from the floor manager the BOYS start their act to the audience's screams. During the number we constantly CUT away to the audience with various SHOTS of the ecstatic girls. In the middle of these shots we see NORM standing at the side of the audience his face glowing with satisfaction. We follow his gaze and from NORM'S P.O.V. we see GRANDFATHER handcuffed to SHAKE, but in spite of this, the old man is enjoying himself. The BOYS now perform a medley of numbers, i.e., a little of all the songs we have heard during the story. This gives the impression of a full set and we finish after their bows. While they are doing so they look again in the general direction of SHAKE and GRANDFATHER and from their P.O.V., we see SHAKE is beating time to the music but from his wrist dangles an empty set of handcuffs. GRANDFATHER has gone again. As the BOYS are reacting to GRANDFATHER's disappearance once again, the trap door on the stage opens and GRANDFATHER appears in the centre of the group as they finish their act and take their final bows. <br> 89. INTERIOR STUDIO CORRIDOR <br> NORM is waiting for the boys. With him are two studio attendants carrying the boys' luggage. As the BOYS excitedly appear he speaks to hem. <br> NORM <br> I've got the stuff. Come here. <br> PAUL <br> Aren't we ... <br> NORM <br> No, we're not! <br> He hurries them along. <br> NORM <br> The office was on the phone, they think it'd be better if we pushed straight to Wolverhampton. <br> JOHN <br> Tonight? We can't make it ... <br> NORM <br> You've got a midnight matinee. <br> JOHN <br> Now, look here, Norm ... <br> NORM <br> No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you. <br> JOHN <br> What? <br> NORM <br> You're a swine. So hurry up ... we're travelling! <br> NORM turns down a side exit where the door is open to the field. In it is an eight-pa**enger helicopter. <br> 90. EXTERIOR STAGE DOOR T.V. THEATRE <br> The BOYS and NORM come out of the building and start to run towards the helicopter. <br> PAUL <br> (looking behind him) <br> Where's my grandfather? <br> NORM <br> (arriving at helicopter door) <br> Don't start. Look. <br> The boys look in the pa**enger bay and there is GRANDFATHER. He is still handcuffed to SHAKE but clutching his pile of photos. <br> GRANDFATHER <br> (beckoning them in with his free hand which holds the photos) <br> Come on, you're hanging up the parade. <br> The boys shout ""Get rid of those things, etc."" <br> 91. EXTERIOR FIELD <br> The final shot is of the helicopter rising up (SHOT FROM BELOW). As it disappears, a shower of photos come from its window. <br> We cut to a CLOSE-UP of one signed photo as it hits the ground and SUPER the closing credits over it."
A Little Rhyme," <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> [Speech] <br> [Rodney Burke:] Now, for the final number, John's got a card in his hand with a little rhyme on it. What is it? <br> [John:] It's from the form up a third at Hemel Hempstead. <br> [Rodney:] Oh! <br> [John:] It says, ""Dear George, John, Ringo, Paul, here's hoping that you'll please us all. A beauty song and swinging voice, we leave it up to you, the choice. We think you're fab and really cool, so brighten up our lads at school."" Dig this, for here's Paul, whistling ""Clarabella""."

We know you've been buying 'em because the sales have been very good, you see. Don't know where we'd be without you, really though. <br> (J): In the army, perhaps. <br> (P): Oh, we hope you've enjoyed listening to the records as much as we've enjoyed melting them - No, no, no, that's worng. - making them. We're in No. 2 studio at the moment, at EMI, taping this little message for you. <br> (J): Yes, we are. <br> (P): We are indeed. I just thought I'd make that... This is the same studio we've used all along - since the old days of ""Love Me Do"" - many years ago it seems, doesn't it? <br> (J): Ah, those were the days ... <br> (P): Well, that's about all, I think. Except, to wish you all a Happy Christmas and a very New Year! Now I'll pa** you over to John. John! <br> (J): John. John speakin'. Thanks all of you who bought me book. Thank you folks for buying it. It was very handy. And there's another one out pretty soon, it says here. Hope you buy that, too. It'll be the usual rubbish but it won't cost much. You see, that's the bargain we're going to strike up. I write them in my spare time, it says here. It's been a busy year .... <br> (P): Did you write this yourself? <br> (J): No! It's somebody's bad handwriter. It's been a busy year Beatle peadles, one way and another. But it's been a great year, too. You fans have seen to that. Page 2. Thanks a lot folks and a hap-py, ah, Christmas and a merry goo-year. Crimble maybe. And I'll hand you to George who will speak to you - now! <br> (G): Thank you John. Thank you. Hi there! I'd like to thank all of you for going to see the film. 'spect a lot of you saw it more than once. <br> (R): I did. <br> (G): Did you? So did I. Thanks anyway. 'Cause it makes us very pleased, ya know. We had a quiet time making it. Actually, we didn't. We had a great time making it. And we're glad it turned out okay. The next one should be completely different. We start shooting it in February. This time it's gonna be in color.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> (J): Green. <br> (G): It'll be a big laugh we hope. (Ha ha ha!) Well, we ... Big laugh, ha ha ha, yeah, it'll be a big laugh. <br> (J): Be a big laugh, you imagine? <br> (G): And we may see all of you soon. Hope so anyway. All the best. And, happy New Year. And a Happy Christmas. And here's Ringo. <br> (R): Thanks, Geroge. Ringo here. Well, the others have thanked you for all the discs and John's book and for everything - oh, no - for enjoying the film. I'd like to thank you just for being fans. It's been a funny year, you know. One minute we're in England, next, we're away. 'spect you're wondering where we've been. Well, Beatle people, we've been to Australia and America and New (Who's dropping that?) New Zealand. And Australia. <br> (P): And New Zealand. <br> (R): Ha ha! Or is that New Zealand? <br> (P): So much travelling!

Fab Four on Film,"INTERVIEWER: Do you think the bug has bitten now? Are you guys – do you have big eyes now to be actors? <br> PAUL: No. <br> GEORGE: Not really, no. We still, you know, even if our film – this, A Hard Day's Night – is the biggest box office attraction ever, you know, it still won't make us feel as though we're actors. But I think we'd all enjoy making a new film. <br> RINGO: Yeah, it's good fun. I think the next one we make will be more fun, because we've sort of got the hang of things. Like on this one, when we first started, when we're not supposed to look at the camera, you'd always sort of find yourself turning ‘round and smiling at it. [laughs] You'd just smile as soon as you saw the camera, you know. <br> PAUL: And on this one, I don't know whether this happens on lots of films, we used to keep breaking up giggling. <br> RINGO: Yeah. <br> PAUL: We had some great giggling fits, you know. We'd sort of say a line, and I kept doing it a particular way. There was one line I kept saying to Ringo, it's about the grandfather in the film who goes off to— <br> RINGO: Well, we can't tell you, ‘cause we'll ruin the film, you see! <br> PAUL: We can't tell you [inaudible] but it was just this one thing where the grandfather goes off to a club, and I was supposed to say to Ringo “It's all your fault” and things. ‘Cause in the film actually, although it's not true in real life, we sort of pick on Ringo a bit, you know, because it was obvious really, because he's sort of smaller and it looks funny in the film. But I'm supposed to be picking on Ringo and saying “It's all your fault” and things. And as I was saying it, I'm a bit – I kept flapping my arms up and down, I don't know why, I must have thought I was a good actor! [laughter] And I was just sort of flapping around and saying, “It's all your fault!” [sound of arms flapping; laughs] Flapping my arms around, and he couldn't stand it, he was giggling away. So then I started laughing, and we just collapsed, and we took so many takes on that bit.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> RINGO: Yeah, twelve takes on that bit. <br> PAUL: Yeah. And I think we cut that bit in the end or something. [laughs] <br> RINGO: Yeah. <br> PAUL: They cut some of it. <br> RINGO: They cut half of it, yeah, but you know, a lot of laughs. All different things that happened were funny to us which, you know, they haven't printed or put on the film, but it's great when we go and see the film, then we can sort of say, “Remember that bit?” if they showed the one we did before, you know, where we all broke up."

Playboy Interview: The Beatles,"Playboy: OK, we're on. Why don't we begin by… <br> John: Doing Hamlet. [Laughter] <br> Ringo: Yeah, yeah, let's do that. <br> Playboy: That sounds like fun, but just for laughs, why don't we do an interview instead? <br> George: Say, that's a fine idea. I wish I'd thought of that. <br> Paul: What shall we ask you for a first question? <br> Ringo: About those Bunny girls… <br> Playboy: No comment. Let's start over. Ringo, you're the last Beatle to join the group, aren't you? <br> Ringo: Yes. <br> Playboy: How long were you fellows working together as a team before Ringo joined up? <br> John: A few years probably, sort of off and on, really, for three years or so. <br> Paul: Yeah, but really amateur. <br> George: The local pub, you know. And in each other's uncles' houses. <br> John: And at George's brother's wedding. Things like that. Ringo used to fill in sometimes for our drummer. <br> Playboy: When you joined the others, Ringo, they weren't quite as big as they are now, were they? <br> Ringo: They were the biggest thing in Liverpool. In them days that was big enough. <br> Paul: This is a point we've made before. Some people say a man is made of muscle and blood… <br> No, they don't. They say, ""How come you've suddenly been able to adjust to fame, you know, to nationwide fame and things?"" It all started quite nicely with us, you see, in our own sphere, where we used to play—in Liverpool. We never used to play outside it, except when we went to Hamburg. Just those two circles. And in each of them, I think we were round the highest paid, and probably at the time the most popular. So in actual fact we had the same feeling of being famous then as we do now. <br> George: We were recognized then, too, only people didn't chase us about. <br> Paul: But it just grew. The quantity grew, not the quality of the feeling. <br> Playboy: When did you know that you had really hit it big? There must have been one night when you knew it had really begun. <br> John: Well, we'd been playing round in Liverpool for a bit without getting anywhere, trying to get work, and the other groups kept telling us, ""You'll do all right, you'll get work someday."" And then we went to Hamburg, and when we came back, suddenly we were a wow. Mind you, 70 percent of the audience thought we were a German wow, but we didn't care about that. <br> Paul: We were billed in the paper: ""From Hamburg—The Beatles."" <br> John: In Liverpool, people didn't even know we were from Liverpool. They thought we were from Hamburg. They said, ""Christ, they speak good English!"" Which we did, of course, being English. But that's when we first, you know, stood there being cheered for the first time. <br> Paul: That was when we felt we were… <br> John: …on the way up… <br> Paul: …gonna make it in Liverpool. <br> Playboy: How much were you earning then? <br> John: For that particular night, 20 dollars. <br> Playboy: Apiece? <br> John: For the group! Hell, we used to work for a lot less than that. <br> Paul: We used to work for about three or four dollars a night. <br> Ringo: Plus all the Coke we could drink. And we drank a lot. <br> Playboy: Do you remember the first journalist who came to see you and said, ""I want to write about you""? <br> Ringo: We went round to them at first, didn't we? <br> John: We went and said, ""We're a group and we've got this record out. Will you…"" <br> George: And then the door would slam. <br> Playboy: We've heard it said that when you first went to America you were doubtful that you'd make it over there. <br> John: That's true. We didn't think we were going to make it at all. It was only Brian telling us we were gonna make it. And George. Brian Epstein, our manager, and George Harrison. <br> George: I knew we had a good chance—because of the record sales over there. <br> John: The thing is, in America it just seemed ridiculous—I mean, the idea of having a hit record over there. It was just, you know, something you could never do. That's what I thought, anyhow. But then I realized that it's just the same as here, that kids everywhere all go for the same stuff. And seeing we'd clone it in England and all, there's no reason why we couldn't do it in America, too. But the American disc jockeys didn't know about British records; they didn't play them; nobody promoted them, and so you didn't have hits. <br> George: Well, there were one or two doing it as a novelty. <br> John: But it wasn't until Time and Life and Newsweek came over and wrote articles and created an interest in us that the disc jockeys started playing our records. And Capitol said, ""Well, can we have their records?"" You know, they had been offered our records years ago, and they didn't want them. But when they heard we were big over here they said, ""Can we have 'em now?"" So we said, ""As long as you promote them."" So Capitol promoted, and with them and all these articles on us, the records just took off. <br> Playboy: There's been some dispute, among your fans and critics, about whether you're primarily entertainers or musicians—or perhaps neither. What's your own opinion? <br> John: We're money-makers first; then we're entertainers. <br> Ringo: No, we're not. <br> John: What are we, then? <br> Ringo: Dunno. Entertainers first. <br> John: OK. <br> Ringo: 'Cause we were entertainers before we were money-makers. <br> John: That's right, of course. It's just that the press drivels it into you, so you say it 'cause they like to hear it, you know? <br> Paul: Still, we'd be idiots to say that it isn't a constant inspiration to be making a lot of money. It always is, to anyone. I mean, why do big business tycoons stay big business tycoons? It's not because they're inspired at the greatness of big business; they're in it because they're making money at it. We'd be idiots if we pretended we were in it solely for kicks. In the beginning we were, but at the same time, we were hoping to make a bit of cash. It's a switch around now, though, from what it used to be. We used to be doing it mainly for kicks and not making a lot of money, and now we're making money without too many kicks—except that we happen to like the money we're making. But we still enjoy making records, going onstage, making films, and all that business. <br> John: We love every minute of it, Beatle people! <br> Playboy: As hard-bitten refugees from the Liverpool slums—according to heartrending fan magazine biographies—do you feel prepared to cope with all this sudden wealth? <br> Paul: We've managed to make the adjustment. Contrary to rumor, you see, none of us was brought up in any slums or in great degrees of poverty. We've always had enough; we've never been starving. <br> John: Yeah, we saw these articles in the American fan mags that ""Those boys struggled up from the slums…"" <br> George: We never starved. Even Ringo hasn't. <br> Ringo: Even I. <br> Playboy: What kind of families do you come from? <br> George: Well, you know, not rich. Just workin' cla**. They've got jobs. Just work. <br> Playboy: What does your father do? <br> George: Well, he doesn't do anything now. He used to be a bus driver… <br> John: In the Merchant Navy. <br> Playboy: Do you have any sisters or brothers, George? <br> George: I've got two brothers. <br> John: And no sisters to speak of. <br> Playboy: How about you, Paul? <br> Paul: I've got one brother, and a father who used to be a cotton salesman down in New Orleans, you know. That's probably why I look a bit tanned. But seriously, folks, he occasionally had trouble paying bills—but it was never, you know, never, ""Go out and pick blackberries, son; we're a bit short this week."" <br> Playboy: How about you, John? <br> John: Oh, just the same. I used to have an auntie. And I had a dad whom I couldn't quite find. <br> Ringo: John lived with the Mounties. <br> John: Yeah, the Mounties. They fed me well. No starvation. <br> Playboy: How about your family, Ringo, old man? <br> Ringo: Just workin' cla**. I was brought up with my mother and me grandparents. And then she married my stepfather when I was 13. All the time she was working. I never starved. I used to get most things. <br> George: Never starved? <br> Ringo: No, I never starved. She always fed me. I was an only child, so it wasn't amazing. <br> Playboy: It's quite fashionable in some circles in America to hate your parents. But none of you seem to. <br> Ringo: We're probably just as against the things our parents liked or stood for as they are in America. But we don't hate our parents for it. <br> Playboy: It's often exactly the opposite in America. <br> Paul: Well, you know, a lot of Americans are unbalanced. I don't care what you say. No, really. A lot of them are quite normal, of course, but we've met many unbalanced ones. You know the type of person, like the political Whig. <br> Playboy: How do you mean? <br> Paul: You know—the professional politician type; in authority sort of thing. Some of them are just mad! And I've met some really maniac American girls! Like this girl who walked up to me in a press conference and said, ""I'm Lily."" I said, ""Hello, how do you do?"" and she said, ""Doesn't my name mean anything to you?"" I said, ""Ah, no…"" and I thought, ""Oh God, it's one of these people that you've met and you should know."" And so Derek, our press agent, who happened to be there at the time, hanging over my shoulder, giving me quotes, which happens at every press conference… <br> George: You better not say that. <br> Paul: Oh yes, that's not true, Beatle people! But he was sort of hanging about, and he said, ""Well, did you ring, or did you write, or something?"" And she said, ""No."" And he said, ""Well, how did you get in touch with Paul? How do you know him?"" And she said, ""Through God."" Well, there was sort of a ghastly silence. I mean, we both sort of gulped and blushed. I said, ""Well, that's very nice, Lily. Thanks very much. I must be off now."" <br> Playboy: There wasn't a big lightning bolt from the sky? <br> Paul: No, there wasn't. But I talked to her afterward, and she said she'd got a vision from God and God had said to her… <br> John: ""It's been a hard day's night."" [Laughter] <br> Paul: No, God had said, ""Listen, Lil, Paul is waiting for you; he's in love with you and he wants to marry you, so go down and meet him, and he'll know you right away."" It's very funny, you know. I was trying to persuade her that she didn't in actual fact have a vision from God, that it was… <br> George: It was probably somebody disguised as God. <br> Paul: You wouldn't hardly ever meet somebody like that in England, but there seemed to me to be a lot like her in America. <br> John: Well, there are a lot more people in America, so you've got a much bigger group to get nutters from. <br> Playboy: Speaking of nutters, do you ever wake up in the morning, look in the mirror and say, ""My God, I'm a Beatle""? <br> Paul: No, not quite. [Laughter] <br> John: Actually, we only do it in each other's company. I know I never do it alone. <br> Ringo: We used to do it more. We'd get in the car, I'd look over at John and say, ""Christ, look at you; you're a bloody phenomenon!"" and just laugh—'cause it was only him, you know. And a few old friends of ours done it, from Liverpool. I'd catch 'em looking at me, and I'd say, ""What's the matter with you?"" It's just daft, them just screaming and laughing, thinking I'm one of them people. <br> Playboy: A Beatle? <br> Ringo: Yes. <br> Paul: The thing makes me know we've made it is like tonight, when we slipped into a sweetshop. In the old days we could have just walked into a sweetshop and nobody would have noticed us. We would have just got our sweets and gone out. But tonight we just walked in—it took a couple of seconds—and the people just dropped their sweets. Before, you see, there would have been no reaction at all. Except possibly, ""Look at that fellow with the long hair. Doesn't he look daft?"" But nowadays they're just amazed; they can't believe it. But actually we're no different. <br> Playboy: The problem is that you don't seem to be like real people. You're Beatles. <br> Paul: I know. It's very funny, that. <br> George: It's all the publicity. <br> Paul: We're taken in by it, too. Because we react exactly the same way to the stars we meet. When we meet people we've seen on the telly or in films, we still think, ""Wow!"" <br> John: It's a good thing, because we still get just as tickled. <br> Paul: The thing is that people, when they see you on TV and in magazines and up in a film, and hear you on the radio, they never expect to meet you, you know, even our fans. Their wish is to meet you, but in the back of their mind they never think they're actually gonna meet us. And so, when they do meet us, they just don't believe it. <br> Playboy: Where do they find you—hiding in your hotel rooms? <br> John: No, on the street, usually. <br> Playboy: You mean you're brave enough to venture out in the streets without a bodyguard? <br> Ringo: Sure. <br> George: We're always on the street. Staggering about. <br> Ringo: Floggin' our bodies. <br> George: You catch John sleeping in the gutter occasionally. <br> Playboy: When people see you in the street, do you ever have any action? <br> George: Well, not really, because when you're walking about, you don't bump into groups of people, as a rule. People don't walk round in gangs, as a rule. <br> Playboy: Can you even go out shopping without getting mobbed by them, individually or collectively? <br> John: We avoid that. <br> Paul: The mountain comes to Mohammed. <br> George: The shop comes to us, as he says. But sometimes we just roll into a store and buy the stuff and leg out again. <br> Playboy: Isn't that like looking for trouble? <br> Paul: No, we walk four times faster than the average person. <br> Playboy: Can you eat safely in restaurants? <br> George: Sure we can. I was there the other night. <br> John: Where? <br> George: Restaurants. <br> Paul: Of course we're known in the restaurants we go in. <br> George: And usually it's only Americans that'll bother you. <br> Playboy: Really? <br> George: Really. If we go into a restaurant in London, there's always going to be a couple of them eating there; you just tell the waiter to hold them off if they try to come over. If they come over anyway, you just sign. <br> Ringo: But you know, the restaurants I go to, probably if I wasn't famous, I wouldn't go to them. Even if I had the same money and wasn't famous I wouldn't go to them, because the people that go to them are drags. The good thing when you go to a place where the people are such drags, such snobs, you see, is that they won't bother to come over to your table. They pretend they don't even know who you are, and you get away with an easy night. <br> George: And they think they're laughing at us, but really we're laughing at them. 'Cause we know they know who we are. <br> Ringo: How's that? <br> George: They're not going to be like the rest and ask for autographs. <br> Ringo: And if they do, we just swear at 'em. <br> George: Well, I don't, Beatle people. I sign the autograph and thank them profusely for coming over and offer them a piece of my chop. <br> John: If we're in the middle of a meal. I usually say, ""Do you mind waiting till I'm finished?"" <br> George: And then we keep eating until they give up and leave. <br> John: That's not true, Beatle people! <br> Playboy: Apart from these occupational hazards, are you happy in your work? Do you really enjoy getting pelted by jelly beans and being drowned out by thousands of screaming subteenagers? <br> Ringo: Yes. <br> George: We still find it exciting. <br> John: Well, you know… <br> Paul: After a while, actually, you begin to get used to it, you know. <br> Playboy: Can you really get used to this? <br> Paul: Well, you still get excited when you go onto a stage and the audience is great, you know. But obviously you're not as excited as you were when you first heard that one of your records had reached number one. I mean, you really do go wild with excitement then; you go out drinking and celebrating and things. <br> Ringo: Now we just go out drinkin' anyway. <br> Playboy: Do you stick pretty much together offstage? <br> John: Well, yes and no. Groups like this are normally not friends, you know; they're just four people out there thrown together to make an act. There may be two of them who sort of go off and are friends, you know, but… <br> George: Just what do you mean by that? <br> John: Strictly platonic, of course. But we're all rather good friends, as it happens. <br> Playboy: Then you do see a good deal of one another when you're not working? <br> Paul: Well, you know, it depends. We needn't always go to the same places together. In earlier days, of course, when we didn't know London, and we didn't know anybody in London, then we really did stick together, and it would really just be like four fellows down from the north for a coach trip. But nowadays, you know, we've got our own girlfriends—they're in London—so that we each normally go out with our girlfriends on our days off. Except for John, of course, who's married. <br> Playboy: Do any of the rest of you have plans to settle down? <br> Paul: I haven't got any. <br> George: Ringo and I are gettin' married. <br> Playboy: Oh? To whom? <br> George: To each other. But that's a thing you better keep a secret. <br> Ringo: You better not tell anybody. <br> George: I mean, if we said something like that, people'd probably think we're queers. After all, that's not the sort of thing you can put in a reputable magazine like Playboy. And anyway, we don't want to start the rumor going. <br> Playboy: We'd better change the subject, then. Do you remember the other night when this girl came backstage… <br> George: Naked… <br> Playboy: Unfortunately not. And she said… <br> George: ""It's been a hard day's night."" <br> Playboy: No, she pointed at you, George, and said, ""There's a Beatle!"" And you others said, ""That's George."" And she said, ""No, it's a Beatle!"" <br> John: And you said, ""This way to the bedroom."" <br> Playboy: No, it was, ""Would you like us to introduce you to him?"" <br> John: I like my line better. <br> Playboy: Well, the point is that she didn't believe that there was such a thing as an actual Beatle person. <br> John: She's right, you know. <br> Playboy: Do you run across many like her? <br> George: Is there any other kind? <br> Playboy: In America, too? <br> Ringo: Everywhere. <br> Playboy: With no exceptions? <br> John: In America, you mean? <br> Playboy: Yes. <br> John: A few. <br> Paul: Yeah. Some of those American girls have been great. <br> John: Like Joan Baez. <br> Paul: Joan Baez is good, yeah, very good. <br> John: She's the only one I like. <br> George: And Jayne Mansfield, Playboy made her. <br> Paul: She's a bit different, isn't she? Different. <br> Ringo: She's soft. <br> George: Soft and warm. <br> Paul: Actually, she's a clot. <br> Ringo: Says Paul, the god of the Beatles. <br> Paul: I didn't mean it, Beatle people! Actually, I haven't even met her. But you won't print that anyway, of course, because Playboy is very pro-Mansfield. They think she's a rave. But she really is an old bag. <br> Playboy: By the way, what are Beatle people? <br> John: It's something they use in the fan mags in America. They all start out, ""Hi there, Beatle people, 'spect you're wondering what the Fab Foursome are doing these days!"" Now we use it all the time, too. <br> Paul: It's low-level journalese. <br> John: But I mean, you know, there's nothing wrong with that. It's harmless. <br> Playboy: Speaking of low-level journalese, there was a comment in one of the London papers the other day that paralleled you guys with Hitler. Seriously! It said that you have the same technique of drawing cheers from the crowd…  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> Paul: That power isn't so much us being like Hitler; it's that the audiences and the show have got sort of, you know, a Hitler feel about them, because the audience will shout when they're told to. That's what that critic was talking about. Actually, that article was one which I really got annoyed about, 'cause she's never even met us. <br> Playboy: She? <br> Paul: The woman who wrote it. She's never met us, but she was dead against us. Like that Hitler bit. And she said we were very boring people. ""The Boresome Foursome,"" she called us. You know, really, this woman was really just shouting her mouth off about us—as people, I mean. <br> Ringo: Oh, come on. <br> Paul: No, you come on. I rang up the newspaper, you know, but they wouldn't let me speak to her. In actual fact, they said, ""Well, I'll tell you, the reason we don't give her phone number out is because she never likes to speak to people on the phone because she's got a terrible stutter."" <br> So I never did actually follow it up. Felt sorry for her. But I mean, the cheek of her, writing this damn article about us. And telling everybody how we're starting riots, and how we were such bores—and she's never even met us, mind you! I mean, we could turn around and say the same about her! I could go and thump her! <br> George: ba*tard fascist! <br> Playboy: Ringo… <br> Ringo: Yes, Playboy, sir? <br> Playboy: How do you feel about the press? Has your attitude changed in the last year or so? <br> Ringo: Yes. <br> Playboy: In what way? <br> Ringo: I hate 'em more now than I did before. <br> Playboy: Did you hear about the riot in Glasgow on the night of your last show there? <br> John: We heard about it after. <br> Playboy: Did you know that the next day there was a letter in one of the Glasgow papers that accused you of directly inciting the violence? <br> Ringo: How can they say that about us? We don't even wiggle. It's not bloody fair. <br> George: ba*tards! <br> Paul: Glasgow is like Belfast. There'll probably be a bit of a skirmish there, too. But it's not because of us. It's because people in certain cities just hate the cops more than in other cities. <br> George: Right. <br> Paul: There were ridiculous riots last time we were there—but it wasn't riots for us. The crowd was there for us, but the riots after our show… <br> Ringo: All the drunks come out, out of the pubs. <br> Paul: …It was just beatin' up coppers. <br> Playboy: They just used the occasion as a pretext to get at the cops? <br> George: Yeah. <br> Paul: In Dublin this trip, did you see where the crowd sort of stopped all the traffic? They even pulled a driver out of a bus. <br> John: They also called out the fire brigade. We had four fire engines this time. <br> Playboy: People were also overturning cars and breaking shop windows. But all this had nothing to do with your show? <br> Paul: Well, it's vaguely related, I suppose. It's got something to do with it, inasmuch as the crowds happen to be there because of our show. <br> John: But nobody who's got a bit of common sense would seriously think that 15-year-old girls are going round smashing shop windows on account of us. <br> George: Certainly not. Those girls are eight years old. <br> Playboy: This talk of violence leads to a related question. Do you guys think there'll be another war soon? <br> George: Yeah. Friday. <br> Ringo: I hope not. Not just after we've got our money through the taxes. <br> John: The trouble is, if they do start another war, then everybody goes with you. <br> Playboy: Do you think the Rolling Stones will be the first to go? <br> Paul: It won't matter, 'cause we'll probably be in London or Liverpool at the time, and when they drop the bomb, it'll be in the middle of the city. So we probably won't even know it when it happens. <br> Playboy: We brought this up for a reason, fellows. There was an essay not long ago in a very serious commentary magazine, saying that before every major war in this century, there has been a major wave of public hysteria over certain specific entertainers. There was the Irene Castle craze before World War One… <br> Paul: Oh, yes. <br> George: I remember that well. <br> Playboy: And then; before World War Two, there was the swing craze, with Benny Goodman and Artie Shaw, and all the dancing in the aisles. And now you—before… <br> John: Hold on! It's not our fault! <br> Playboy: We're not saying you may have anything to do with inciting a war… <br> Paul: Thanks. <br> Playboy: But don't you think you may be a symptom of the times, part of an undercurrent that's building up? <br> Paul: That sort of comparison just falls down when you look at it, really. It's just like saying that this morning a fly landed on my bed and that I looked at my watch and it was eight o'clock, and that therefore every morning at eight o'clock flies land on the bed. It doesn't prove anything just 'cause it happens a few times. <br> Playboy: Let's move on to another observation about you. Did you know that the Duke of Edinburgh was recently quoted as saying that he thought you were on your way out? <br> John: Good luck, Duke. <br> George: No comment. See my manager. <br> Paul: He didn't say it, though. There was a retraction, wasn't there? <br> John: Yeah, we got a telegram. Wonderful news. <br> Paul: We sent one back. Addressed to ""Liz and Phil."" <br> Playboy: Have you ever met the Queen? <br> John: No, she's the only one we haven't met. We've met all the others. <br> Paul: All the mainstays. <br> Playboy: Winston Churchill? <br> Ringo: No, not him. <br> John: He's a good lad, though. <br> Playboy: Would you like to meet him? <br> George: Not really. Not more than anybody else. <br> Paul: I dunno. Somebody like that you wish you could have met when he was really at his peak, you know, and sort of doing things and being great. But there wouldn't be a lot of point now, because he's sort of gone into retirement and doesn't do a lot of things anymore. <br> Playboy: Is there any celebrity you would like to meet? <br> Paul: I wouldn't mind meeting Adolf Hitler. <br> George: You could have every room in your house papered. <br> Playboy: Would you like to meet Princess Margaret? <br> Paul: We have. <br> Playboy: How do you like her? <br> Ringo: OK. And Philip's OK, too. <br> Playboy: Even after what he supposedly said about you? <br> Ringo: I don't care what he said; I still think he's OK. He didn't say nothing about me personally. <br> Paul: Even if he had said things about us, it doesn't make him worse, you know. <br> Playboy: Speaking of royalty… <br> Paul: Royalty never condemns anything unless it's something that they know everybody else condemns. <br> Ringo: If I was royal… <br> Paul: If I was royal I would crack long jokes and get a mighty laugh. If I was royal. <br> George: What would we do with Buckingham Palace? Royalty's stupid. <br> Playboy: You guys seem to be pretty irreverent characters. Are any of you churchgoers? <br> John: No. <br> George: No. <br> Paul: Not particularly. But we're not antireligious. We probably seem to be antireligious because of the fact that none of us believe in God. <br> John: If you say you don't believe in God, everybody a**umes you're antireligious, and you probably think that's what we mean by that. We're not quite sure what we are, but I know that we're more agnostic than atheistic. <br> Playboy: Are you speaking for the group or just for yourself? <br> John: For the group. <br> George: John's our official religious spokesman. <br> Paul: We all feel roughly the same. We're all agnostics. <br> John: Most people are, anyway. <br> Ringo: It's better to admit it than to be a hypocrite. <br> John: The only thing we've got against religion is the hypocritical side of it, which I can't stand. Like the clergy is always moaning about people being poor, while they themselves are all going around with millions of quid worth of robes on. That's the stuff I can't stand. <br> Paul: A new bronze door stuck on the Vatican. <br> Ringo: Must have cost a mighty penny. <br> Paul: But believe it or not, we're not anti-Christ. <br> Ringo: Just anti-Pope and anti-Christian. <br> Paul: But you know, in America… <br> George: They were more shocked by us saying we were agnostics. <br> John: They went potty; they couldn't take it. Same as in Australia, where they couldn't stand us not liking sports. <br> Paul: In America they're fanatical about God. I know somebody over there who said he was an atheist. The papers nearly refused to print it because it was such shocking news that somebody could actually be an atheist. Yeah, and admit it. <br> Ringo: He speaks for all of us. <br> Playboy: To bring up another topic that's shocking to some, how do you feel about the h*mos**ual problem? <br> George: Oh yeah, well, we're all h*mos**uals, too. <br> Ringo: Yeah, we're all queer. <br> Paul: But don't tell anyone. <br> Playboy: Seriously, is there more h*mos**uality in England than elsewhere? <br> John: Are you saying there's more over here than in America? <br> Playboy: We're just asking. <br> George: It's just that they've got crewcuts in America. You can't spot 'em. <br> Paul: There's probably a million more queers in America than in England. England may have its scandals—like Profumo and all—but at least they're heteros**ual. <br> John: Still, we do have more than our share of queers, don't you think? <br> Paul: It just seems that way because there's more printed about them over here. <br> Ringo: If they find out that somebody is a bit bent, the press will always splash it about. <br> Paul: Right. Take Profumo, for example. He's just an ordinary… <br> Ringo: Sex maniac. <br> Paul: …just an ordinary fellow who sleeps with women. Yet it's adultery in the eyes of the law, and it's an international incident. But in actual fact, if you check up on the statistics, you find that there are hardly any married men who've been completely faithful to their wives. <br> John: I have! Listen, Beatle people… <br> Paul: All right, we all know John's spotless. But when a thing like that gets into the newspapers, everybody goes very, very Puritan, and they pretend that they don't know what s** is about. <br> George: They get so bloody virtuous all of a sudden. <br> Paul: Yes, and some poor heel has got to take the brunt of the whole thing. But in actual fact, if you ask the average Briton what they really think of the Profumo case, they'd probably say, ""He was knockin' off some bird. So what?"" <br> Playboy: Incidentally, you've met Mandy Rice-Davies, haven't you? <br> George: What are you looking at me for? <br> Playboy: Because we hear she was looking at you. <br> John: We did meet Christine Keeler. <br> Ringo: I'll tell you who I met. I met what's-her-name—April Ashley. <br> John: I met her, too, the other night. <br> Playboy: Isn't she the one who used to be a man, changed her s** and married into the nobility? <br> John: That's the one. <br> Ringo: She swears at me, you know. But when she sobers up she apologizes. <br> John: Actually, I quite like her. Him. It. That. <br> Paul: The trouble with saying something like, ""Profumo was just a victim of circumstances"" or ""April Ashley isn't so bad, even though she's changed s**""—saying things like that in print to most people seems so shocking; whereas in actual fact, if you really think about it, it isn't. Just saying a thing like that sounds much more shocking than it is. <br> Ringo: I got up in the Ad Lib the other night and a big handbag hit me in the gut. I thought it was somebody I knew; I didn't have any gla**es on. I said, ""Hello,"" and a bloody big worker ""Arrgghhh."" So I just ran into the bog. Because I'd heard about things like that. <br> Playboy: What are you talking about? <br> George: He doesn't know. <br> Playboy: Do you? <br> George: Haven't the slightest. <br> Playboy: Can you give us a hint, Ringo? What's the Ad Lib, for example? <br> Ringo: It's a club. <br> George: Like your Peppermint Lounge, and the Whisky à GoGo. It's the same thing. <br> Paul: No, the English version is a little different. <br> John: The Whisky à GoGo is exactly the same, isn't it, only they have someone dancing on the ceiling, don't they? <br> George: Don't be ridiculous. They have two girls dancing on the roof; and in the Ad Lib they have a colored chap. That's the difference. <br> Playboy: We heard a rumor that one of you was thinking of opening a club. <br> John: I wonder who it was, Ringo. <br> Ringo: I don't know, John. There was a rumor, yes. I heard that one, too. <br> Playboy: Is there any truth to it? <br> Ringo: Well, yes. We was going to open one in Hollywood, but it fell through. <br> John: Dino wouldn't let you take the place over. <br> Ringo: No. <br> Paul: And we decided it's not worth it. So we decided to sit tight for six months and then buy… <br> George: America. <br> Playboy: Have you heard about the Playboy Club that's opening in London? <br> Ringo: Yes, I've heard about it. <br> Playboy: What do you think of our Clubs? <br> Ringo: They're for dirty old men, not for the likes of us—dirty young men. They're for businessmen that sneak out without their wives knowing, or if their wives sneak out first, for those who go out openly. <br> George: There's no real fun in a Bunny's fluffy tail. <br> Playboy: Then you don't think a Club will make it here? <br> George: Oh yes, 'course it will. <br> Ringo: There's enough dirty old men here. <br> Playboy: Have you ever read the magazine? <br> John: Yes. <br> George: Yes. <br> Ringo: I get my copy every month. Tits. <br> Playboy: Do you read the [The Playboy] Philosophy, any of you? <br> Paul: Some of it. When the journey's really long and you can't last out the pictures, you start reading it. It's OK. <br> Playboy: How about Playboy's Jazz Poll? Do you read it, too? <br> John: Occasionally. <br> Playboy: Do you enjoy jazz, any of you? <br> George: What kind? <br> Playboy: American jazz. <br> John: Who, for example? <br> Playboy: You tell us. <br> Paul: We only dig those who dig us. <br> Playboy: Seriously, who? Anyone? <br> John: Getz. But only because somebody gave me an album of his. With him and somebody called Iguana, or something like that. <br> Playboy: You mean João Gilberto? <br> John: I don't know. Some Mexican. <br> Playboy: He's Brazilian. <br> John: Oh. <br> Playboy: Are you guys getting tired of talking? <br> John: No. <br> Paul: No, let's order some drinks. Scotch or Coke? <br> John: I'll have chocolate. <br> George: Scotch for me and Paul and chocolate for the Beatle teenager. <br> John: Scotch is bad for your kidneys. <br> Paul: How about you, Ringo? Don't you want something to keep you awake while you're listening to all this rubbish? <br> Ringo: I'll have a Coke. <br> John: How about you, Playboy, are you man or woman? <br> Paul: It's a Beatle people! <br> George: Who's your fave rave? <br> Paul: I love you! <br> George: How gear. <br> Playboy: Speaking of fave raves, why do you think the rock-'n'-roll phenomenon is bigger in England than in America? <br> John: Is it? <br> Paul: Yes. You see, in England, after us, you have thousands of groups coming out everywhere, but in America they've just sort of had the same groups going for ages. Some have made it and some haven't, but there aren't really any new ones. If we'd been over there instead of over here, there probably would have been the same upsurge over there. Our road manager made an interesting point the other day about this difference in America. In America the people who are the big stars are not our age. There's nobody who's a really big star around our age. Possibly it may seem like a small point, but there's no conscription—no draft—here. In America we used to hear about somebody like Elvis, who was a very big star and then suddenly he was off in the Army. <br> John: And the Everly Brothers. <br> Paul: Yes, the Everly Brothers as well went into the Army at the height of their fame. And the Army seems to do something to singers. It may make them think that what they're playing is stupid and childish. Or it may make them want to change their style, and consequently they may not be as popular when they come out of the Army. It may also make people forget them, and consequently they may have a harder job getting back on top when they get out. But here, of course, we don't have that problem. <br> John: Except those who go to prison. <br> Paul: It's become so easy to form a group nowadays, and to make a record, that hundreds are doing it—and making a good living at it. Whereas when we started, it took us a couple of years before the record companies would even listen to us, never mind give us a contract. But now, you just walk in and if they think you're OK, you're on. <br> Playboy: Do you think you had anything to do with bringing all this about? <br> John: It's a damn fact. <br> Paul: Not only us. Us and people who followed us. But we were the first really to get national coverage because of some big shows that we did, and because of a lot of public interest in us. <br> Playboy: What do you think is the most important element of your success—the personal appearances or the records? <br> John: Records. Records always have been the main thing. P.A.s follow records. Our first records were made, and then we appeared. <br> Playboy: Followed closely by Beatle dolls. Have you seen them? <br> George: They're actually life size, you know. <br> Playboy: The ones we've seen are only about five inches high. <br> Paul: Well, we're midgets, you see. <br> Playboy: How does it make you feel to have millions of effigies of yourselves decorating bedsides all over the world? Don't you feel honored to have been immortalized in plastic? After all, there's no such thing as a Frank Sinatra doll or an Elvis Presley doll. <br> George: Who'd want an ugly old crap doll like that? <br> Playboy: Would you prefer a George doll, George? <br> George: No, but I've got a Ringo doll at home. <br> Playboy: Did you know that you're probably the first public figures to have dolls made of them—except maybe Yogi Berra? <br> John: In Jellystone Park. Do you mean the cartoon? <br> Playboy: No. Didn't you know that the cartoon character is based on a real person—Yogi Berra, the baseball player? <br> George: Oh. <br> Playboy: Didn't you know that? <br> John: I didn't know that. <br> Paul: Well, they're making us into a cartoon, too, in the States. It's a series. <br> John: The highest achievement you could ever get. <br> Paul: We feel proud and humble. <br> Playboy: Did you know, George, that at the corner of 47th Street and Broadway in New York, there is a giant cutout of you on display? <br> George: Of me? <br> Playboy: Life size. <br> Ringo: Nude. <br> Playboy: No—but the reason we mention it is that this is really a signal honor. For years on that corner, there's been a big store with life-size cutouts of Marilyn Monroe, Anita Ekberg or Jayne Mansfield in the window. <br> John: And now it's George. <br> Paul: The only difference is they've got bigger tits. <br> Ringo: I suppose that's one way of putting it. <br> George: The party's getting rough. I'm going to go to bed. You carry on, though; I'll just stop my ears with cotton—so as not to hear the insults and the smutty language. <br> Playboy: We've just about run out of steam anyway. <br> John: Do you have all you need? <br> Playboy: Enough. Many thanks, fellows. <br> John: 'Course a lot of it you won't be able to use—""crap"" and ""bloody"" and ""tit"" and ""ba*tard"" and all. <br> Playboy: Wait and see. <br> Ringo: Finish your Scotch before you go. <br> John: You don't mind if I climb into bed, do you? I'm frazzled. <br> Playboy: Not at all. Good night. <br> Ringo: Good night, Playboy. <br> George: It's been a hard day's night."

The Beatles' 1968 Christmas Record,"(R): Hello, this is a big ""Hi"" and a sincere Merry Christmas from yours truly, Ringo Starr. <br> (P): (Singing) <br> Happy New Year, happy Christmas, <br> Happy Easter, happy autumn. <br> Happy Michelmas, ev'rybody, <br> Happy Christmas, ev'rybody to you. <br> I'd like to wish ev'rybody happy Christmas <br> This year of 1968 going on 69. <br> Happy Christmas, happy New Year, <br> All the best to you from here. <br> Ah - haaa! <br> I'd like to wish ev'rybody <br> Happy Christmas, happy New Year. <br> From there to here, <br> Happy New Year, happy New Year, <br> Happy New Year, happy New Year. <br> When I get to the bottom <br> I go back to the top of the slide, <br> Where I stop and I turn and I go for a ride <br> Till I get to the bottom and I see you again. <br> (J): Once upon a time, there were two balloons called <br> Jock and Yono. They were strictly in love, bound to happen <br> in a million years. They were together man. Unfortunate <br> timetable, they seemed to have previous experience which <br> kept calling them one way or another. You know how it is. <br> But they battled on against overwhelming oddities, <br> including some of their beast friends. Being in love, <br> they clung together even more man. But some of the <br> poisonous monsters' outdated boss - lordy ape claws did <br> stick slightly, and they occasionally had to resort to <br> the dry cleaners. Luckily, this did not k** them and <br> they weren't banned form the Olympic Games. They lived <br> hopefully ever after and who could blame them? <br> (G): Well, here we are again, another fab Christmas. Christmas <br> time is here again. Ain't been around since last year. <br> And we'd like to take this opportunity, all the way from <br> America, to say happy Christmas to you our faithful, <br> beloved fans all over the world who have made our life <br> worth living. And over here I have Mr. Malcolm Evans who <br> through thick and thin would surely like to say a word <br> of greeting at this festive occasion. <br> (M): Merry Christmas children everywhere! <br> (?): At the first stroke, it will be ... <br> (R): ... Ringo Starr. Thank you! <br> ""Good evening."" <br> ""Hello me dear. I didn't know you were coming."" <br> ""I'm not surprised."" <br> ""Well, I am! Certainly am!"" <br> ""I would have thought so myself."" <br> ""Well, if you ask me, I think it's insane."" <br> ""Occasionally."" <br> ""Yes, me, too. Twice a week sometimes."" <br> ""Fourteen and six."" <br> ""Nineteen and five to save me if you don't mind."" <br> ""Yes, I know."" <br> ""Don't you say yes to me! I'm telling you!"" <br> ""This is a private line, you know."" <br> ""Private line? I've been on this line for two years.""  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> (R): Well, it's my proud pleasure tonight to introduce one of <br> the most versatile performers in our career. And he's <br> come all the way from Stokely Carmichel's -on-Sea. <br> And I hope you're going to like him. Let's give him a <br> big hand ... <br> (P): (Singing) <br> Happy New Year, happy Christmas, <br> Happy Easter, happy autumn, <br> Happy Michelmas, ev'rybody, <br> Happy Christmas, ev'rybody to you. <br> (J): Once upon a pool table there lived a short-haired <br> butcher's boy by the way of Ostergrad. It comes in <br> scented cesspool or be careful. Her father was in a <br> long story cut short in the middle of his life sentence. <br> We're indebted to the colloquial office for its immediate <br> disposal of her honorwitz, including, I might add, half a <br> fell of her twotem (*hoc virtallo a totem?). On the other handbag, I mean to say <br> l'amoure ne soome tu joure realistic, strictly speaking. <br> For this film is about an hourgla** houseboat. The full <br> meaning of Winchester Cathedral defies description. Their <br> loss was our Gainsborough nil. <br> (J (Double Tracked)): <br> The sound of a manservantile defectively lasting barred <br> up in a love-dizzy gar-di-dell time. How close can you <br> Gettysburg and ever underly council ya originally a <br> birdbath feeling? <br> (G): Cut! <br> We have a special guest here this evening, Mr. <br> Tiny Tim. I'd like to ask him to say a few words. <br> (T): Oh, hello to you nice Beatles. Ah, it's so wonderful, <br> what a thrill it is talking here. Ah, in Mr. Harrison's <br> presence, Mr. Weiss' presence, and all his nice wonderful <br> friends. And the thing is, I just wanna say Merry <br> Christmas to you all. And, ah, a Happy New Year. <br> (G): Thank you, Tiny. Would you like to sing us a little song? <br> (T): Ah, I'd love to. Here's a song I did in 1966 in front of <br> Miss Jill for the first time. And I did this in Albert <br> Hall, and what a thrill it was, ah, to do this then, and <br> now ... exactly the way I did it then. <br> (Singing) <br> He's a, ooh, real nowhere man, <br> Living in his nowhere land, <br> Making all his nowhere plans for nobody. <br> Hasn't got a point of view, <br> Knows not where he's going to, <br> Isn't he a bit like you and me? <br> Nowhere man, (yes?) Don't worry, <br> Take your time, don't hurry, <br> Nowhere man, the world's at your command, ooh. <br> He's a, huh huh, real nowhere man, <br> Living in his nowhere land, <br> Making all his nowhere plans for nobody, ooh, ooh. <br> (G): Thank you, Tiny. Thank you and God bless you, Tiny. <br> (T): God bless you all. Oh, God bless you all."
The Beatles' Christmas Record,"Ho! <br> Good King Wenceslas looked out <br> On the feast of Stephen (Hoo!) <br> As the slow ray round about <br> Deep and crisp and crispy <br> Brightly show the boot last night <br> On the mosty cruel <br> Henry Hall and David Lloyd <br> Betty Grable too-oo-oo <br> Hello, this is John, speaking with his voice. (Huh!) <br> We're all very happy to be able to talk to you like this on this little bit of plastic. This record reaches you at the end of a really gear year for us, and it's all due to you. When we made our first record on Parlophone towards the end of 1962, we hoped everybody would like what had already been our type of music for several years already. But we had no idea of all the gear things in store for us. It all happened really when Please Please Me became a number one hit and after that, well cor' the blimeys, heave the mo'! Our biggest thrill of the year, well, I suppose it must have been topping the bill at the London Palladium and then, only a couple of days later, being invited to take part in The Royal Variety Show. This time last year, we were all dead chuffed because ""Love Me Do"" got into the top twenty, and we can't believe really that so many things have happened in between already! Just before I pa** you over to Paul, (Arf-arf! Arf-arf!) I'd like to say thank you to all the Beatle people who have written to me during the year and everyone who sent gifts and cards for my birthday, which I'm trying to forget, in October. (Huh!) I'd like to reply personally to everyone, but I just haven't enough pens. In the meantime: <br> Garry Crimble to you <br> Garry Mimble to you <br> Getty Bable, dear Christmas <br> Happy Birthday me too <br> This is Paul here. <br> Everything that John said goes for me too, 'specially the bit about birthday cards and the parcels, 'cause all our homes and offices got stacks of mail last June, ow! Ha! Ha! When it was my birthday. Anyway, we're all dead pleased by the way you've treated us in 1963, and we'll try to do everything we can to please you with the type of songs we write and record next year. Oh yeah, somebody asked us if we still like jelly babies. Well! We used to like them, in fact we loved them and said so in one of the papers, you see. Ever since then, we've been getting them in boxes, packets and crates. Anyway, we've gone right off jelly babies, you see, but we still like peppermint creams and chocolate drops and dolly mixtures and all that sort of thing. (Yes! Yes! Oh yes!) <br> Well, lots of people asked us what we enjoy best, you see, concerts and television or recording? We like doing stage shows 'cause it's, you know, it's great to hear an audience enjoying themselves. But the thing we like best, I think so anyway, is going into the recording studio (yes, we enjoy that very kindly) to make new records, which is what we've been doing all day before we started on this special message. Well, eh, what we like to hear most is one of our songs, you know, taking shape in a recording studio, ah, one of the ones what John and I have written, and then listening to the tapes afterwards to hear how it all worked out, you see. Well, I'm running over my time, and people are telling me to stop, (Stop! Stop!) and Ringo, (Stop! Stop! Shouting those animals!) so I'll finish off now with it wishing everyone Happy Crimble and a Merry New Year and especially all the ones who paid the subscription.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> Ja, das wird uns danke schon <br> Und denn gruss von even <br> Ja, denn gruss von even schon <br> Ja, das wird wunderschon, boy <br> Danke schon <br> Ja, Ringo! <br> Hello, Ringo here. <br> As you know I was the last member to join The Beatles. I started to play drums in the group 1962, ha-ha-ha! Have been in a couple of other groups... (Oh, just wish the people a merry, happy, go on, for Christmas, Christmas) Merry, Happy New Year, and folks, Happy Christmas and may, may everything you wish be granted. <br> (Sing, sing us Wenceslas, King Wenceslas) <br> King Wenceslas: <br> Well, good King Wenceslas looked out (Oh ho!) <br> On the feast of Stephen (Hey!) <br> When the snow was on the ground (Yeah!) <br> Deep and crisp and even (Oh yeah!) <br> Hooray! <br> Thank you, Ringo! Thank you, Ringo! We'll phone you! (Ha ha ha!) <br> I'm George Harrison. Nobody else has said anything yet about our fan club secretaries, Ann Collingham and Bettina Rose, not to mention Freda Kelly in Liverpool. (Good old Freda!) So on behalf of us all, I'd just like to say a great, big thank you to Ann, Bettina and Freda for all the hard work they've done, and we just hope you can go on pleasing you for a long time, 'cause it's gonna, 'cause it to your reaction are to our records that really matters. <br> And I'd just like to say: <br> Brightly was the shone that night <br> Though the winter cruel <br> When a pork pie came inside <br> Gathering winter cruel <br> Rudolph, the red nosed reindeer (Ho!) <br> Had a very shiny nose (A shiny nose!) <br> When ev'rybody picked it... <br> Ha, ha, ha, ha... <br> Oh yeah! Oh! <br> Rudolph, the red nosed Ringo (Rudolph!) <br> Had a very shiny nose <br> Merry Christmas everybody!"

Get help! <br> FRED <br> Where should I go? <br> MAYOR <br> No time for trivialities. <br> As the Blue Meanies bomb the Mayor, Fred sails. <br> CREDITS <br> 0:07:41 THE BEATLES: YELLOW SUBMARINE <br> In the town where I was born <br> Lived a man who sailed to sea <br> And he told us of his life <br> In the land of submarines <br> So we sailed on to the sun <br> Till we found the sea of green <br> And we lived beneath the waves <br> In our Yellow Submarine <br> We all live in a Yellow Submarine <br> Yellow Submarine, Yellow Submarine <br> We all live in a Yellow Submarine <br> Yellow Submarine, Yellow Submarine <br> And our friends are all aboard <br> Many more of them live next door <br> And the band begins to play <br> We all live in a Yellow Submarine <br> Yellow Submarine, Yellow Submarine <br> … <br> Full speed ahead, Mr. Boatswain. <br> Full speed ahead. <br> Full speed it is, sir. <br> Action stations! Action stations! <br> Aye, sir, aye. <br> Captain, Captain! <br> Page 5 <br> As we live a life of ease <br> Every one of us has all we need <br> Sky of blue and sea of green <br> In our Yellow Submarine <br> We all live in a Yellow Submarine, <br> Yellow Submarine, Yellow Submarine, <br> … <br> 0:10:20 THE YELLOW SUBMARINE GETS TO LIVERPOOL <br> 0:11:03 THE BEATLES: ELEANOR RIGBY <br> Ah, look at all the lonely people <br> Ah, look at all the lonely people <br> Eleanor Rigby <br> Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been <br> Lives in a dream <br> Waits at the window <br> Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door <br> Who is it for? <br> All the lonely people <br> Where do they all come from? <br> All the lonely people, <br> where do they all belong? <br> Father McKenzie <br> Writing the words of a sermon that no-one will hear <br> No-one comes near <br> Look at him working <br> Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there <br> What does he care? <br> All the lonely people, <br> where do they all come from? <br> All the lonely people, <br> where do they all belong? <br> Ah, look at all the lonely people <br> Ah, look at all the lonely people <br> Eleanor Rigby <br> Died in the church and was buried along with her name <br> Nobody came <br> Father McKenzie <br> Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave <br> No-one was saved <br> All the lonely people, <br> where do they all come from? <br> All the lonely people, <br> where do they all belong? <br> Page 6 <br> 0:13:14 STREET OF LIVERPOOL <br> RINGO <br> Who... is me? Liverpool can be a lonely place on a Saturday night. And this is only <br> Thursday morning. Compared with my life, Eleanor Rigby's was a gay, mad whirl. <br> Nothing ever happens to me. I feel like an old, splintered drumstick. I'd jump into the <br> River Mersey, but it looks like rain. Nothing ever happens to me. <br> As Ringo walks down Hope Street, is followed by the submarine. A bobby lies on the <br> floor playing with a cat. <br> BOBBY <br> Puss, puss-puss. Puss, puss, puss. Here, p**y. Here, p**y, p**y, p**y. <br> Here, p**y, p**y. [The Bobby sees Ringo] Ahem, er... <br> RINGO <br> Would you believe me if I told you I was being followed by a yellow submarine? <br> BOBBY <br> No, I would not. <br> RINGO <br> Oh yeah, I didn't think you would. <br> Ringo goes up a hill to reach The Pier, the house when he lives with the other <br> Beatles. <br> RINGO <br> I could have sworn there was a yellow submarine. But that isn't logical, is it? It must <br> have been one of them unidentified flying cupcakes or a figment of my imagination. <br> But I don't have an imagination. <br> Ringo enters the house. Fred comes and knocks at the door. <br> FRED <br> Help, help, help! <br> RINGO, from inside <br> Thanks, I don't need any. <br> FRED <br> Help! Won't you please, please help me? <br> RINGO <br> Be specific. <br> FRED <br> ... music ... submarine ... Blue Meanies!!! <br> RINGO <br> What you need is... <br> Page 7 <br> FRED <br> 'H' for hurry, 'E' for ergent, 'L' for love me and 'P' for p-p-p-p-please help. <br> 0:16:08 THE HOUSE OF THE BEATLES <br> Door opens and Fred enters. There is a long corridor with many doors. A lot of <br> stranges things enter and leave the rooms. <br> VOZ <br> Hiya, baby! <br> Ringo goes downstairs in a car. <br> RINGO <br> Your story has touched my heart. Jump in, we'll get my friends. <br> FRED <br> Bless you! <br> RINGO <br> Did I sneeze? <br> They return to the corridor. <br> FRED <br> Just park it here. <br> RINGO <br> I'll just park it here. <br> They enter through a door. <br> FRED <br> What would your friends be doing here? <br> RINGO <br> Displaying. <br> FRED <br> Displaying what? <br> RINGO <br> Displaying around. <br> The room is full of interesting objects, like a museum. <br> FRED <br> Can't we take one of these? <br> RINGO <br> No, Fred, I only work with me mates. <br> Page 8 <br> FRED <br> Frankenstein? <br> RINGO <br> I used to go out with his sister. <br> FRED <br> His sister? <br> RINGO <br> Yeah. Phyllis. Hey, I wonder what would happen if I pulled this lever. <br> FRED <br> You mustn't do that. <br> RINGO <br> Can't help it. I'm a born lever-puller. <br> He does it. Frankenstein gets up and takes a drink. Then he becomes John. <br> JOHN <br> Ringo, I've just had the strangest dream. <br> RINGO <br> I warned you not to eat on an empty stomach. Now listen to Old Fred. <br> FRED <br> ... music ... submarine ... Blue Meanies!!! <br> RINGO <br> What do you think? <br> JOHN <br> I think he needs a rehearsal. <br> They return to the hall. <br> JOHN <br> When do we leave? <br> RINGO <br> Let's get the other two, John. <br> JOHN <br> What day is it? <br> RINGO <br> Sitar-day. <br> JOHN <br> Then George will be here. <br> Page 9 <br> He opens a door. Indian images. <br> 0:18:55 THE BEATLES: LOVE YOU TO (beginning) <br> RINGO <br> George, what are you doing up there? <br> GEORGE, driving a red car <br> Now, what is it, Ringo? Is there a matter you'd like to take up or down? <br> RINGO, pointing Old Fred <br> This chap here... <br> FRED, John and Ringo also say the last words <br> ...Blue Meanies!!! <br> GEORGE <br> You're nuts, the pair of you. <br> RINGO <br> Wait a minute, that's my car. <br> GEORGE <br> How do you know it's your car? <br> RINGO <br> I'd know it anywhere. <br> GEORGE <br> What's it look like, then? <br> RINGO <br> It's red with yellow wheels. (The car changes colours) I mean, blue with orange <br> wheels. <br> GEORGE <br> It's all in the mind. <br> All they get into the car. <br> RINGO <br> Come on, move over, I'm driving. <br> GEORGE <br> I got here first. <br> They argue about who will drive. <br> RINGO/GEORGE <br> I'll drive, if you like... No, you sit in the middle... I'm sitting in the middle... You said <br> you were driving... I am driving... I'll get in the back, then. <br> Page 10 <br> Finally, they departed. A car crash is heard. They return and open a door. Inside the <br> room there is a girl lying on a bed. King-Kong looks through the window and grabs <br> the girl. <br> JOHN <br> Do you think we're interrupting something? <br> RINGO <br> I think so. We'd better find Paul, hadn't we? <br> John opens another door. A train is coming at full speed. John closes scared. <br> GEORGE <br> It's all in the mind. <br> JOHN <br> Try one of those doors. <br> Ringo does it. Inside the room there is a loud party. <br> GEORGE <br> Yes, they do look very nice, don't they? <br> RINGO <br> Yes, they do. <br> JOHN <br> They do, though, don't they? <br> GEORGE <br> Yes, they do. <br> RINGO <br> Don't dey, dough? <br> GEORGE <br> Dough? <br> Paul meets them. <br> JOHN <br> Don't ask. Dat's dough. <br> PAUL <br> What's the matter, folks? <br> RINGO <br> Blue Meanies. <br> FRED <br> Well, lads, what do you think? <br> Page 11 <br> JOHN, as they walk <br> I think that... <br> FRED <br> Remember, there'll be rough seas ahead. So, what do you think? <br> PAUL <br> Well, then, um... <br> FRED <br> Pounding, overwhelming waves. What do you think of that? <br> JOHN <br> Well, I think that... <br> RINGO <br> As a matter of fact, I... <br> BEATLES <br> I think... <br> FRED <br> Well? <br> RINGO <br> I've forgotten. <br> They all go out and stop in front of the submarine. <br> FRED <br> Right, then, let's get this vessel shipshape. <br> JOHN <br> I kind of like the way it is, submarine shape. <br> 0:22:18 THE JOURNEY BEGINS <br> We see a series of landscapes. We hear the end of “A day in the life”. <br> 0:22:45 INSIDE THE SUBMARINE <br> PAUL <br> So, this is a submarine. <br> JOHN <br> Soft, isn't it? <br> RINGO <br> Not if you're on the bottom. <br> FRED <br> All right, lads, time to stow the gab and turn to. <br> Page 12 <br> PAUL <br> Groovy. How do you start this thing? <br> FRED <br> It starts with a Blue Meanie attack. <br> JOHN <br> Supposing there's no Blue Meanies in the neighbourhood? <br> FRED <br> Then you start looking for a switch. <br> RINGO <br> Perhaps this is it. <br> The submarine sails in a strange world. <br> 0:23:22 THE BEATLES: ALL TOGETHER NOW <br> One, two, three, four / Can I have a little more? <br> Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten / I love you <br> A, B, C, D / Can I bring my friend to tea? <br> E, F, G, H, I, J / I love you <br> Sail the ship <br> Chop the tree <br> Skip the rope <br> Look at me <br> All together now <br> All together now (all together now)… <br> Black, white, green, red / Can I take my friend to bed? <br> Pink, brown, yellow, orange and blue / I love you (All together now) <br> All together now (all together now), <br> all together now (all together now)... <br> Sail the ship <br> Chop the tree <br> Skip the rope <br> Look at me <br> All together now <br> All together now (all together now)… <br> 0:25:30 THE SEA OF TIME <br> RINGO <br> What time is it? <br> Page 13 <br> JOHN <br> It's time to time. <br> PAUL <br> Look, the hands are slowing down. <br> The submarine sails back. <br> PAUL <br> Do you ever get the feeling... <br> JOHN <br> Yeah. <br> PAUL <br> … that things aren't as rosy as they appear to be under the surface? <br> RINGO <br> What's happening, John? <br> JOHN <br> Well, in my humble opinion, we've become involved in Einstein's time-space <br> continuum theory. <br> GEORGE <br> All right. <br> JOHN <br> Relatively speaking, that is. <br> GEORGE <br> Of course. Maybe time's gone on strike. <br> RINGO <br> What for? <br> GEORGE <br> Shorter hours. <br> RINGO <br> I don't blame it. It must be very tiring being time, mustn't it? <br> JOHN & PAUL <br> Why? <br> RINGO <br> It's a twenty-four hour day, isn't it? <br> JOHN <br> You surprise me, Ringo. <br> RINGO <br> Page 14 <br> Why? <br> JOHN <br> Dealing in abstracts. <br> RINGO <br> Just because I'm a drummer... I don't half feel funny. <br> Ringo shrinks. <br> PAUL, shrinking too <br> You're not half the lad you used to be. <br> GEORGE, same <br> Look, everything's getting bigger. <br> JOHN, same <br> It's not. It's us that are getting smaller... <br> RINGO, mourning <br> I want my mam. <br> FRED <br> And younger. There you are, lads. Old Fred will get you out of all this. <br> RINGO, pointed outside <br> Look at that! <br> GEORGE <br> It's all a load of Father Xmas's. <br> JOHN <br> It's not. It's Father Time. <br> GEORGE <br> How do you know? <br> JOHN <br> I read it in a book. <br> FRED <br> I don't want to alarm you, but the years are going backwards. <br> GEORGE <br> What's that mean, Old Fred? <br> FRED <br> It means if we slip back through time at this rate, very soon we'll all disappear up our <br> own existence. <br> JOHN <br> What are we gonna do, then? <br> Page 15 <br> FRED <br> We could always try a few bu*tons. <br> RINGO, sobs <br> I want my mam. <br> FRED <br> Time's fast running out for us, I'm afraid! <br> JOHN <br> Can't we do something to the clock? <br> GEORGE <br> What do you mean, John? <br> JOHN <br> Move the hands forward, see what happens. <br> FRED <br> Clever lad. <br> John forces the clockwise and the submarine goes ahead. <br> JOHN <br> Something strange is happening. It's speeding up now. <br> PAUL, looking outside <br> Funny... a submarine remarkably like our own. <br> JOHN <br> Uncannily. <br> RINGO <br> There's someone in it. Look. <br> JOHN <br> And they're waving. <br> RINGO <br> It's a group of fellas. <br> JOHN <br> Wave back. Maybe we're both part of a vast yellow submarine fleet. <br> RINGO <br> There's only two of us. <br> JOHN <br> Then I would suggest that yonder yellow submarine is one of ourselves… <br> FRED <br> Page 16 <br> Going backwards... <br> JOHN <br> … in time! <br> GEORGE <br> Look at Ringo. <br> Ringo is getting older, and so the rest. <br> JOHN <br> Oh dear, we're all the same. <br> PAUL <br> Senile delinquents. <br> GEORGE <br> And I can hear my beard growing. <br> RINGO <br> We'd better do something. <br> 0:28:20 THE BEATLES: WHEN I'M SIXTY FOUR <br> When I get older, losing my hair <br> Many years from now <br> Will you still be sending me a valentine <br> Birthday greetings, bottle of wine <br> If I'd been out till quarter to three <br> Would you lock the door? <br> Will you still need me, <br> will you still feed me <br> When I'm sixty-four? <br> You'll be older, too <br> And if you say the word <br> I could stay with you <br> I could be handy mending a fuse <br> When your lights have gone <br> You can knit a sweater by the fireside <br> Sunday mornings, go for a ride <br> As Paul sings, time is going back and The Beatles turn back to their real age. <br> We can read a title: “sixty-four years is 33.661.440 minutes and one minute is a <br> long time… Let us demonstrate”. <br> Doing the garden, digging the weeds <br> Who could ask for more? <br> Will you still need me, <br> will you still feed me <br> When I'm sixty-four? <br> Page 17 <br> A series of well illustrated numbers accompany the voice of Paul form 1 to 64, <br> matching the last one with the end of the song. <br> Every summer we can rent a cottage <br> in the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear <br> We shall scrimp and save <br> Grandchildren on your knee, <br> Vera, Chuck and Dave <br> Send me a postcard, drop me a line <br> Stating point of view <br> Indicate precisely <br> what you mean to say <br> Yours sincerely, wasting away <br> Give me your answer, fill in a form, <br> mine forever more <br> Will you still need me, <br> will you still feed me <br> When I'm sixty-four? <br> JOHN <br> Well, correct me if I'm wrong, gentlemen, but would you agree that we have been <br> pa**ing through the Sea of Time? <br> RINGO <br> That would explain a few things. I'm glad I'm not young any more. Or was it old? <br> JOHN <br> What kind of a sea is this? <br> FRED <br> The Sea of Science. <br> JOHN <br> Oh, yeah. <br> 0:31:15 THE BEATLES: A NORTHERN SONG <br> If you're listening to this song <br> You may think the chords are going wrong <br> But they're not <br> He just wrote it like that <br> When you're listening late at night <br> You may think the band are not quite right <br> But they are <br> They just play it like that <br> It doesn't really matter <br> What chords I play <br> What words I say <br> Or time of day it is <br> Cause it's only a Northern Song <br> Page 18 <br> It doesn't really matter <br> What clothes I wear <br> Or how I fare or if my hair is brown <br> When it's only a Northern Song <br> If you think the harmony <br> Is a little dark and out of key <br> You're correct <br> There's nobody there <br> And I told you there's no-one there. <br> 0:33:46 A MONSTER WITH A TRUNK AND TUSKS <br> As the song sounded The Beatles evolved through the space. When they come back <br> to the submarine a strange animal enters with them. <br> GEORGE <br> He looks wrong. <br> PAUL <br> He doesn't look at all well. <br> GEORGE <br> In fact, he's horrible. <br> JOHN, hiding himself <br> He's so ugly. <br> ALL <br> Really ugly! <br> The animal breaks to mourn. <br> FRED <br> Somebody push a bu*ton. <br> Ringo does and the animal is ejected outside the submarine to the Sea of Monsters. <br> 0:34:18 SEA OF MONSTERS <br> JOHN <br> There's a Cyclops. <br> PAUL <br> Can't be. He's got two eyes. <br> JOHN <br> Then it must be a bi-Cyclops. <br> GEORGE <br> There's another one. <br> Page 19 <br> JOHN <br> A whole cyclopedia. <br> Among the monsters there is one that swallows everything. The Beatles look out the <br> hatch. <br> JOHN <br> There's a school of whales. <br> RINGO <br> They look a bit old for school. <br> PAUL <br> University, then. <br> RINGO, drives the submarine <br> University of Whales. They look like dropouts to me. <br> FRED <br> You've got to steer clear! <br> RINGO <br> Steer clear? <br> FRED <br> Yes, steer. Clear? <br> RINGO <br> Yes, dear. <br> Ringo presses a bu*ton. The submarine shows a big smile. The whales smile too. <br> FRED <br> Now, whatever you do, don't touch that bu*ton. <br> RINGO <br> Which bu*ton? <br> FRED <br> That one. <br> RINGO, <br> This one? <br> Ringo presses the bu*ton and he is ejected from the submarine on the back of a <br> dinosaur. Before he is eaten he is rescued by a kind of horse. <br> FRED <br> That was the panic bu*ton. <br> PAUL <br> Page 20 <br> Poor Ringo. <br> JOHN <br> Poor lad. <br> GEORGE <br> Never did no harm to no-one. <br> JOHN <br> Lads, now Ringo's gone, what are we gonna do? <br> FRED <br> Learn to sing trios. <br> PAUL <br> No, let's save the poor devil. <br> JOHN <br> I see footsteps. <br> FRED <br> It's a pair of kinky boot-beasts. <br> JOHN <br> Preparing to attack. <br> The boots tryes to step on the submarine. But Paul presses a bu*ton and the <br> submarine steps on the boots. <br> JOHN <br> I don't half miss Ringo. <br> PAUL <br> He's far out there. <br> JOHN <br> Always was. <br> RINGO <br> 'H' is for hurry! <br> PAUL <br> Here comes Ringo! <br> Ringo rides horseback. <br> JOHN <br> There goes Ringo. <br> A Boxing monster approaches the submarine. <br> GEORGE <br> Page 21 <br> It's seen us. <br> FRED <br> Find a boxing bu*ton. <br> PAUL <br> Whoever heard of a boxing bu*ton? <br> JOHN <br> Who cares? Find one. <br> The Boxing monster hits the submarine. <br> FRED, pushes a bu*ton <br> Fire one! <br> The submarine expels lot of stranges gadgets, including a banner with the words <br> “The Rolling Sto”. <br> FRED <br> Uh-oh, wrong one. <br> JOHN <br> That. <br> The submarine flatters the monsters with a cigar. We hear “Air on the G-string”, de <br> Bach until the cigar explodes. <br> GEORGE <br> There goes Ringo again. <br> JOHN <br> Rides well, doesn't he? <br> RINGO <br> 'E' is for ergent... <br> The vacuum monster appears again. <br> FRED <br> Oh no, not the dreaded vacuum again. <br> PAUL <br> We'll be s**ed into oblivion. <br> GEORGE <br> Or even further. <br> FRED <br> Put her in reverse. <br> JOHN <br> Page 22 <br> So long, s**er. <br> PAUL <br> Too much. <br> GEORGE <br> Too soon. <br> FRED <br> Reverse! Reverse! <br> JOHN <br> Ringo time. <br> Another monster is swallowed by the vacuum monster. <br> RINGO <br> 'L' is for love me... <br> Indians go chasing Ringo. <br> JOHN <br> Indians! <br> RINGO <br> Help! Help! 'P' is for please... <br> JOHN <br> So, press a bu*ton. <br> 0:39:33. The seventh cavalry leaves the submarine and rescues Ringo. <br> JOHN <br> How was it, Ringo? <br> RINGO <br> 'Arrowing. <br> The vacuum monster keeps gobbling other monsters. <br> FRED <br> Look who's back. Full speed ahead. <br> RINGO <br> Oh, no. <br> JOHN <br> The motor's packing in. <br> FRED <br> By all the sea nymphs, we're losing power. We're being swallowed. What shall we <br> do? <br> Page 23 <br> PAUL <br> Serve tea. <br> JOHN <br> Lovely. <br> The vacuum monster swallows everythig, even it self. <br> FRED <br> By Neptune's knickerbockers, she's puttered out. <br> JOHN <br> Maybe we should call a road service. <br> PAUL <br> Can't. No road. <br> RINGO <br> And we're not sub-scribers. <br> JOHN, PAUL, GEORGE <br> Subscribers! Oh! <br> GEORGE <br> I know something about motors. Let me have a look. <br> FRED <br> Here. <br> GEORGE <br> Is that the motor? <br> FRED <br> Can't you tell one when you see one? <br> GEORGE <br> Of course I can. Let me peruse it. <br> Put his finger on the motor and gets a shock. <br> JOHN <br> What do you think? <br> GEORGE <br> I think I burned my finger. <br> RINGO, looking outside <br> Here, lads. Look at this. <br> JOHN <br> What do you think it is? <br> Page 24 <br> GEORGE <br> Nothing. <br> RINGO <br> Looks like nothing. <br> PAUL <br> It's a local inhabitant. <br> RINGO <br> He's probably one of the nothings. <br> PAUL <br> At least that's something. Let's show him our motor. <br> JOHN <br> Steady on. You don't want to show your motor to just anybody. <br> GEORGE <br> But this is a nobody. <br> JEREMY <br> Medic, pedic, zed oblique, <br> orphic, morphic, dorphic, Greek. <br> Ad hoc, ad loc and quid pro quo. <br> So little time, so much to know. <br> JOHN <br> Can you tell us where we're at? <br> JEREMY <br> A true Socratic query, that. <br> JOHN <br> And who the Billy Shears are you? <br> JEREMY <br> Who? Who indeed am I? <br> He gives a different visiting card to anyone. <br> JOHN <br> Jeremy? <br> PAUL <br> Hillary? <br> GEORGE <br> b**b? <br> RINGO <br> Page 25 <br> Ph. D? <br> ALL <br> Who? <br> JEREMY <br> Eminent physicist, polyglot cla**icist, <br> prize-winning botanist, <br> hard biting satirist, <br> talented pianist, good dentist, too. <br> JOHN <br> Lousy poet. <br> JEREMY <br> Critic's voice, take your choice. <br> RINGO <br> Must be one of them angry young men. <br> PAUL <br> Or a daffy old creep. <br> JEREMY <br> I, daffy old creep? <br> GEORGE <br> Do you speak English? <br> JEREMY <br> Old English, middle, a dialect, pure... <br> PAUL <br> Well, do you speak English? <br> JEREMY <br> You know, I'm not sure. <br> RINGO <br> He's so smart, he doesn't even remember what he knows. <br> PAUL <br> Why don't we show him our motor? <br> JOHN <br> Should we really... show him our motor? <br> PAUL <br> He may not have seen one before. <br> JEREMY <br> Turbo-prop, super-combustible spring. <br> Page 26 <br> Metrocyclonic and stereophonic, <br> this motor, I see, has a broken down thing. <br> JOHN <br> He fixed it? <br> PAUL <br> He fixed it. <br> GEORGE <br> Great. Let's go. <br> JEREMY <br> I must complete my bust, two novels, <br> finish my blueprints, begin my beguine. <br> JOHN <br> Must you always talk in rhyme? <br> JEREMY <br> If I spoke prose, you'd all find out, <br> I don't know what I talk about. <br> Ad hoc, ad loc and quid pro quo. <br> So little time, so much to know. <br> PAUL <br> Hey, fellas. Look. <br> JEREMY <br> The footnotes for my 19th book. <br> This is my standard procedure for doing it. <br> And while I compose it, <br> I'm also reviewing it. <br> GEORGE <br> A b**b for all seasons. <br> PAUL <br> How can he lose? <br> JOHN <br> Were your notices good? <br> JEREMY <br> It's my policy never to read my reviews. <br> JOHN <br> There must be a word for what he is. <br> 0:43:00 THE BEATLES: NOWHERE MAN <br> He's a real Nowhere Man <br> Page 27 <br> Sitting in his Nowhere Land <br> Making all his Nowhere plans for nobody <br> Doesn't have a point of view, <br> Knows not where he's going to <br> Isn't he a bit like you and me <br> Nowhere Man, please listen, <br> You don't know what you're missing <br> Nowhere Man, the world is at your command <br> He's as blind as he can be, <br> Just sees what he wants to see  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> Nowhere Man, can you see me at all? <br> Nowhere Man, don't worry, <br> Take your time, don't hurry <br> Leave it all till somebody else <br> lends you a hand <br> Doesn't have a point of view, <br> Knows not where he's going to <br> Isn't he a bit like you and me <br> Nowhere Man, please listen, <br> You don't know what you're missing <br> Nowhere Man, the world is at your command <br> He's a real Nowhere Man, <br> Sitting in his nowhere land <br> Making all his Nowhere plans for nobody <br> Making all his Nowhere plans for nobody <br> Making all his Nowhere plans for nobody <br> JOHN <br> Okay, men, all aboard. Let's go somewhere. <br> RINGO <br> What about him? <br> JOHN <br> He's happy enough going around in circles. <br> RINGO <br> Poor little fella. <br> PAUL <br> I don't know. Ringo's just a sentimentalist. <br> RINGO <br> Look at him. Can't he come with us? [Goes upto him] <br> Mr. b**b, you can come with us, if you like. <br> Page 28 <br> JEREMY <br> You mean, you'd take a Nowhere Man? <br> RINGO <br> Come on, we'll take you somewhere. <br> Inside the submarine, John gives Fred the motor. <br> JOHN to Jeremy <br> Okay, b**by. Down the hatch. <br> JEREMY laughs <br> Down the hatch. A quite curious phrase. <br> The middle South Midlands <br> Victorian phase. <br> Its usage undoubtedly on the increase. <br> I must work it into <br> my New Statesman piece. <br> JOHN <br> That's the hatch, friend. <br> JEREMY <br> Indeed. <br> FRED <br> Steady now, crew. Prepare to go forward. <br> GEORGE <br> Forward. <br> PAUL <br> Forward. <br> JOHN <br> Forward. <br> RINGO <br> Forward. <br> ALL <br> Forward! <br> But the submarine has problems going forward. <br> JOHN <br> It's awfully quiet. <br> GEORGE <br> What shall we do, Jeremy? <br> JEREMY <br> Page 29 <br> Repair, revive, revamp, renew. <br> Ipse dixit, just turn the screw. <br> [Ipse dixit = he said] <br> The Beatles and the Nowhere man go outside. <br> JEREMY <br> Log sign, clog sign, big thingamabob. <br> JOHN <br> What's he saying? <br> PAUL <br> What's he doing? <br> JEREMY <br> Chewing gum will do the job. A turn of the screw, and all is and all is new. <br> The submarine stars, but only Fred is on board. <br> FRED <br> I can't stop her. 'H' is for hurry, 'E' is for ergent, 'L' is for love me… <br> JOHN <br> 'P' is for... goodbye? <br> GEORGE <br> That was lovely, Jeremy. <br> PAUL <br> We've lost the sub for good. <br> JOHN <br> Or for bad. Or for worse. <br> JEREMY <br> I'm sorry about that. <br> RINGO <br> But he did fix the motor. <br> PAUL <br> Where are we? <br> They stand on a head. There are a lot of heads around. <br> JOHN <br> It looks like the foothills. <br> PAUL <br> The foothills of what? <br> JOHN <br> Page 30 <br> The foothills of the headlands. <br> 0:48:06 THE BEATLES: LUCY IN THE SKY WITH DIAMONDS <br> Picture yourself in a boat on a river <br> With tangerine trees <br> and marmalade skies <br> Somebody calls you, <br> you answer quite slowly <br> A girl with kaleidoscope eyes <br> Cellophane flowers of yellow and green <br> Towering over your head <br> Look for the girl with the sun <br> in her eyes and she's gone <br> Lucy in the sky with diamonds <br> Lucy in the sky with diamonds <br> Lucy in the sky with diamonds <br> Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain <br> Where rocking horse people <br> eat marshmallow pies <br> Everyone smiles <br> as you drift past the flowers <br> That grow so incredibly high <br> Newspaper taxis appear on the shore <br> Waiting to take you away <br> Climb in the back with your head <br> in the clouds and you're gone <br> Lucy in the sky with diamonds <br> Lucy in the sky with diamonds <br> Lucy in the sky with diamonds <br> Picture yourself on a train in a station <br> With Plasticine porters <br> with looking gla** ties <br> Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile <br> The girl with kaleidoscope eyes <br> Lucy in the sky with diamonds… <br> 0:51:09 ON THE FOOTHILLS OF THE HEADLANDS <br> JOHN <br> Carry on, lads, carry on. <br> RINGO <br> Certainly was carrying on. <br> Page 31 <br> JOHN <br> I feel a draft. <br> PAUL <br> We must be near the Sea of Holes. Don't you think we should ask somebody for <br> directions? <br> JOHN, talks to a ma** of heads <br> Excuse us... <br> PAUL <br> Can you tell us the way to Pepperland? <br> JOHN <br> Thanks. <br> PAUL <br> Gosh, look at all this dust? Where did it come from? <br> JEREMY <br> A chemical error and quite imprecise. This is a condiment... <br> RINGO <br> Condi... <br> JEREMY <br> A spice. <br> JOHN <br> He's right, you know. It's pepper. <br> PAUL <br> Pepper? <br> GEORGE <br> Pepper. <br> They smell and sneeze. The ma** of heads sneeze too. They fly into the Sea of <br> Holes. <br> 0:52:08 THE SEA OF HOLES <br> RINGO <br> John? Paul? George? Is anybody home? <br> PAUL <br> Where are we? <br> JOHN <br> A holey sea. This place reminds me of Blackburn, Lancashire. <br> Page 32 <br> PAUL <br> Oh, boy... <br> GEORGE <br> How many do you think there are in all? <br> JEREMY <br> Enough to fill the Albert Hall. <br> PAUL <br> Didn't Old Fred mention something about the Sea of Holes just before the Sea of <br> Green? <br> JOHN <br> Yeah. <br> GEORGE <br> Through one of them spots must be the Sea of Green. But which? Which one? <br> JEREMY <br> Thesis, antithesis, synthesis, causes of causal causation. <br> JOHN <br> Jeremy, what do you know about holes? <br> JEREMY <br> There are simply no holes in my education. <br> PAUL <br> You mean you haven't composed a whole book? <br> GEORGE <br> Great. What shall we do? <br> JEREMY <br> Be empirical. Look. <br> RINGO <br> The b**by's making more and more sense. <br> PAUL <br> It's getting better all the time. <br> JOHN <br> Great. Come on, let's all look for the Sea of Green. The Sea of Holes... into the Sea <br> of Green. <br> JEREMY <br> Hydrolate, verdant chrysodine. <br> I think we're near the Sea of Green. <br> Page 33 <br> Jeremy Man is caught in a leg by a Blue Meanie. Ringo picks a hole up and plays for <br> a while before to put it in his pocket. <br> RINGO <br> I've got a hole in me pocket. <br> PAUL <br> Where's Jeremy? <br> JOHN <br> He was over there. <br> GEORGE <br> He's not here now. <br> PAUL <br> He must have jumped ship, then. <br> RINGO <br> He wouldn't do that. He's our friend. b**by, Jeremy, Hillary, where are you? <br> 0:54:29 Suddenly, everything is tinted of green as we hear a bit part of the song <br> Yellow submarine: “Sea of green, sea of green, sea of green, green, green, green...” <br> The Beatles arrive to Pepperland, just on the base of the temple. <br> 0:54:41 PEPPERLAND <br> JOHN <br> Pepperland. A bit salty around the edges. Looks all dingy. <br> GEORGE <br> And drab. <br> PAUL <br> And quiet. <br> Ringo finds a pile of apples. Take one and pa**es it to Paul. <br> JOHN <br> Safe at last. <br> PAUL <br> And none the worse for our adventures. <br> JOHN <br> Reminiscent in many ways of the late Mr. Ulysses. <br> RINGO <br> There's an eye in the apples. <br> Page 34 <br> Ringo brings down the apples and uncover the Mayor. The Yellow submarine comes <br> down from the sky and lands on the house of music. Fred descends sitting down in <br> an anchor. <br> FRED <br> There she blows! Lord Mayor, sir... I've made it, I'm back. <br> GEORGE <br> Who's this? <br> FRED <br> Our Lord Mayor. He's been bonked. [Ringo removes the apples]. Lord Mayor, sir... <br> unbonk yourself. Even a little snatch of a tune might get him up again. <br> JOHN <br> All right, let's sing. <br> 0:55:54 THE BEATLES: HAVE YOU GOT TIME TO RECTIFY <br> Have you got time to rectify, time to rectify... <br> MAYOR <br> Do I hear music? Do I see... Young Fred? <br> FRED <br> You do, Lord Mayor. <br> MAYOR <br> Bless my metronome. And did you bring the help? <br> FRED <br> Yes, yes. Look. <br> MAYOR <br> Holy pizzicato, Young Fred. It's quite uncanny, your faces... <br> PAUL <br> We're quite cute, really. <br> MAYOR <br> You could pa** for the originals. <br> JOHN <br> We are the originals. <br> They go downstairs from the house of music. <br> MAYOR <br> No, no... Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. <br> RINGO <br> They couldn't be much with a name like that. Sergeant Pepper? <br> Page 35 <br> FRED <br> You could impersonate them and rally the land to rebellion. <br> MAYOR <br> Where are your instruments? <br> JOHN <br> Lost in the Monstrous Sea. <br> PAUL <br> Sea of Monsters. <br> FRED <br> We'll get other instruments, Lord Mayor. <br> MAYOR <br> Not a chance. The Meanies captured everything that maketh music. <br> PAUL <br> They hate music that much, do they? <br> MAYOR <br> They shrink at the very sound. <br> JOHN <br> Okay, you guys. It's shrinking time in Pepperland. <br> All people in Pepperland keeps grey and motionless (except for escape from the blue <br> meanies). <br> BLUE MEANIE <br> Aim, fire! <br> The Beatles hide behind cut-outs. <br> PAUL <br> He reminds me of my old English teacher. <br> JOHN <br> Look, if you must shout, shout quietly. <br> GEORGE <br> What do we do? <br> JOHN <br> Coagulate with the crowd. <br> PAUL <br> Cut-outs at the ready. <br> JOHN <br> Page 36 <br> Then let's cut out. <br> They come to a high bandstand surrounded by thorns. <br> PAUL <br> What a grand bandstand. <br> JOHN <br> That's where the gear's kept. Come on. <br> Blue meanies with dogs. <br> GEORGE <br> Cavey, cavey. <br> At dusk. <br> PAUL <br> All right, the coast is clear. <br> GEORGE <br> Now's our chance. <br> RINGO <br> But how'll we get over? <br> GEORGE <br> Easy. Follow me. <br> They jump the fence of thorns <br> BLUE MEANIE <br> A-ha! You fools! <br> The watch fires his machine gun. <br> The Beatles reach the bandstand moving between asleep blue meanies. <br> RINGO <br> It's not very light in here, is it? <br> GEORGE <br> Shh! Keep the noise down. <br> JOHN <br> Look what I found. It's their uniforms. <br> PAUL <br> Nice bit of gear, that. <br> RINGO <br> They'll look great on, eh? <br> Page 37 <br> PAUL <br> Dey will, won't dey? <br> RINGO <br> Won't dey, dough. <br> JOHN <br> How do I look? <br> PAUL <br> Groovy, groovy. How about me? <br> RINGO, looking thru the window <br> Bad scene, lads. We're surrounded. <br> GEORGE <br> Oh, heck. <br> RINGO <br> A million billion Meanies. <br> PAUL <br> They're coming this way. <br> ALL <br> Hide! <br> Trying to hide they make a lot of noise. <br> PAUL <br> Do you think they heard us? <br> JOHN <br> I hope not. <br> GEORGE <br> What did you say? <br> SOMEONE <br> Shhhh! <br> GEORGE <br> Good plan. <br> 1:03:22 DAWN, by Grieg. <br> PAUL <br> Look. They're all asleep. <br> RINGO <br> They look cute when they're asleep. Almost human. <br> Page 38 <br> GEORGE <br> Come on. Let's get out of here. <br> PAUL <br> On tiptoe. <br> They take their instruments and go down the hill. <br> RINGO <br> Tiptoe through the Meanies... <br> THE OTHER <br> Shh! <br> Ringo steps on the bagpipe. Some meanies wake. <br> PAUL <br> Let's exude. <br> The Beatles are persecuted. Ringo falls down and jumps on the John arms. <br> GEORGE <br> Relax, lads. Not a Meanie in sight. <br> JOHN <br> Not even a teeny Meanie. <br> PAUL <br> Not even a teeny-weeny Meanie. <br> RINGO <br> Great. <br> PAUL <br> Oh, look. Breakfast. <br> RINGO <br> I'm dying for a bit of brekky. <br> George takes an apple. Four tall meanies do the same. <br> JOHN <br> Look out. <br> A blue meanie heads the four tall meanies. <br> CHIEF <br> Sound off, one, two, three, four... <br> TALL MEANIES <br> One, two, three, four... <br> Page 39 <br> The Beatles, one above the other, march behind the row of tall meanies. <br> JOHN <br> Five. <br> CHIEF <br> Five? [John eliminates the last one with an apple stroke.] Sound off, one, two, three, <br> four. <br> TALL MEANIES <br> One, two, three... <br> JOHN <br> Four. <br> John eliminates another one. <br> TALL MEANIES <br> One, two... <br> JOHN <br> Three. <br> CHIEF <br> Three? <br> JOHN <br> Two. <br> CHIEF <br> Two? <br> JOHN <br> One. <br> CHIEF <br> One? [The chief stares at the column made of the four Beatles] Are you Bluish? You <br> don't look Bluish. <br> JOHN <br> Run for it. <br> The Beatles escape again. <br> PAUL <br> Right, men. We've made it. <br> GEORGE <br> Instruments at the ready. <br> JOHN <br> Okay, on the beat. A-one, a-two, a-three, a-four, a-five, a-six… <br> Page 40 <br> RINGO <br> Hey, can't you make it three? <br> JOHN <br> All right. On the beat of three... A-one, a-two, a-three... <br> 1:06:34 THE BEATLES: SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND <br> It was twenty years ago today, <br> Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play <br> They've been going in and out of style, <br> But they're guaranteed to raise a smile <br> So may I introduce to you, <br> The act you've known for all these years <br> Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band <br> We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band <br> We hope you will enjoy the show <br> Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band <br> Sit back and let the evening go <br> Sgt. Pepper's Lonely, <br> Sgt. Pepper's Lonely <br> Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band <br> It's wonderful to be here, <br> it's certainly a thrill <br> You're such a lovely audience, <br> we'd like to take you home with us <br> We'd love to take you home <br> I don't really wanna stop the show, <br> But I thought you might like to know <br> That the singer's gonna sing a song, <br> And he wants you all to sing along <br> So let me introduce to you, <br> The one and only Billy Shears <br> Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band <br> Billy Shears! <br> What would you think if I sang out of tune? <br> Would you stand up and walk out on me? <br> Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song <br> And I'll try not to sing out of key <br> The inhabitants of Pepperland recover color and smile. Lennon has been presented <br> as Billy Shears, but Ringo's voice is heard. <br> 01:08:49 THE MEANIES GATHER AROUND THEIR CHIEF <br> CHIEF BLUE MEANIE <br> Page 41 <br> Ah! The hills are alive... <br> ASSISTANT <br> With the sound of music. <br> The Chief Blue Meanie hits his a**istant. Then he gets a tantrum. <br> CHIEF BLUE MEANIE <br> Who is responsible for this? <br> ASSISTANT <br> Rimsky Korsakov? <br> The a**istant is shot and kicking, but still resurfaces. <br> ASSISTANT <br> Guy Lombardo? <br> CHIEF BLUE MEANIE, laughs <br> My dear friend... let us not forget that heaven is blue. [Suddenly choleric] Tomorrow, <br> the world! Bring in my Bluebird. <br> PEPPERLAND INHABITANTS <br> Who? Who? Who? <br> PAUL, GEORGE, RINGO <br> Who? Who? Who? <br> The mouth of John expels the question WHO? <br> A blue big glove crosses the air. <br> CHIEF BLUE MEANIE <br> Ah! Here you are, my little Glovey-dovey. Go get thee hence and destroy yon <br> upstarts. [New rage] Smash them! Squash them! Crash them! Oblue-terate them! <br> MEDICAL DOCTOR, as the Chief collapses <br> Here, your Blueness, have some nasty medicine. <br> CHIEF, exuberant <br> The Glove, the Glove, the Glove! <br> PAUL, GEORGE, RINGO <br> Glove? Glove? Glove? <br> From the mouth of John emerge the word GLOVE. <br> GEORGE <br> He's a clever lad, isn't he? <br> RINGO <br> Open your mouth, it won't hurt. [Try to see into the mouth of John] John, you haven't <br> half got a big mouth, haven't you? <br> Page 42 <br> GEORGE <br> It's easy. All you need is love. <br> JOHN <br> Yes. <br> And expeles again the word GLOVE, but this time the initial G vanishes. <br> 1:12:02 THE BEATLES : ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE <br> Love, love, love (x3) <br> There's nothing you can do that can't be done <br> Nothing you can sing that can't be sung <br> Nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game <br> It's easy <br> All you need is love <br> All you need is love <br> All you need is love, love, <br> Love is all you need <br> Nothing you can know that isn't known, <br> Nothing you can see that isn't shown <br> There's nowhere you can be <br> that isn't where you're meant to be <br> It's easy <br> All you need is love, (All together now) <br> All you need is love, (Everybody) <br> All you need is love, love, <br> Love is all you need <br> All you need is love <br> All you need is love <br> All you need is love, love <br> The words emerged from the mouth of John neutralize the glove attacks. <br> JOHN <br> Go, Glove, lovely Glove. <br> RINGO <br> You took the words right out of my mouth, John. <br> GEORGE <br> Hey, wait, and watch. [Floating] It's all in the mind, you know. <br> Love is all you need <br> Love is all you need <br> Page 43 <br> Everything revives in Pepperland. The word NO becomes NOW and then KNOW. <br> She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah <br> The meanies flee and The Beatles are acclaimed by the crowd. <br> A little bit further they find a blue gla** ball. <br> GEORGE <br> Hey, that's a funny place to leave a goldfish bowl. <br> JOHN <br> In Pepperland all things are possible. <br> PAUL <br> It's not a goldfish bowl. <br> RINGO <br> Just a big gla** bowl, then. <br> PAUL <br> Yes, blue gla**. <br> RINGO <br> It must be from Kentucky. <br> Paul knocks the bowl. Some music starts to sound. <br> JOHN <br> There's something inside. <br> RINGO <br> Four fellas. <br> GEORGE <br> What are they doing there? <br> PAUL <br> They're not having a ball, that's for sure. <br> JOHN <br> It can't be. <br> PAUL <br> It's us. <br> JOHN <br> But we're here. <br> PAUL <br> It's Sgt. Pepper's... <br> RINGO <br> Page 44 <br> Lonely... <br> GEORGE <br> Hearts Club... <br> GEORGE <br> Band. <br> JOHN <br> The resemblance is truly striking. If I could come in here I think the theory put forward <br> by Einstein… <br> PAUL, spoofs an old song called ‘Any old iron' <br> Any old Ein, any old Ein, any, any, any old Einstein. <br> JOHN <br> … could well be applied here. The people in the ball are obviously extensions of our <br> own personalities, suspended, as it were, in time, frozen in space, according to the <br> now famous Theory of Relativity, which, briefly explained, is simply a matter of taking <br> two eggs... <br> The other three try to break the ball. <br> PAUL <br> John! <br> JOHN <br> … beating lightly and adding a little salt and pepper... <br> GEORGE <br> John! <br> JOHN <br> George? <br> GEORGE <br> How do we get them out? <br> JOHN <br> Break the gla**. <br> GEORGE <br> We can't. It's Beatle-proof. <br> JOHN <br> Nothing is Beatle-proof. <br> PAUL, to Ringo <br> Have you got your drumsticks with you? A drum break might shatter it. <br> RINGO <br> No, I haven't. <br> Page 45 <br> GEORGE <br> Have a look in your pocket. <br> 1:15:50 “Baby you're a rich man” is heard. <br> RINGO <br> I've got a hole in my pocket. I wonder if... <br> Ringo sticks the hole on the ball. The ball gets empty. <br> RINGO <br> Yeah, it still works. <br> GEORGE <br> We take back all we said. <br> JOHN <br> You're a genius. <br> PAUL <br> A sheer genius. <br> RINGO <br> I know, I know, I know. [Some colors get out of the ball] Like coloured telly. <br> GEORGE <br> Like crystal. <br> PAUL <br> They're decanting. <br> The members of the Band face their peers. <br> RINGO 2 <br> Hello, brother. <br> RINGO <br> Yeah, without a doubt. <br> GEORGE <br> We're the spitting image of each other. <br> GEORGE 2 <br> Golly, yeah. <br> JOHN <br> I'm led to believe that you're an extension of my personality. <br> JOHN 2 <br> Yes, I'm your alter-ego man. <br> Page 46 <br> JOHN <br> And I'm the ego man, goo goo, g'joob. [They walk together] I'm glad you asked me <br> that. Because as a matter of fact there's a war on. Then, brothers in war, to the <br> skirmish must we hence. <br> JOHN 2 <br> Shall we hence? <br> PAUL <br> Let's not waste time sitting on the hence. Beatles to battle. Charge! <br> The Blue Meanies attack again. The Beatles run for a hide. <br> JOHN <br> We're surrounded. <br> RINGO, pointing the four-headed dog <br> Nice dog, though. <br> The Beatles hide inside a hurdy-gurdy. John turns the crank and sings: <br> 1:17:26 THE BEATLES : HEY BULLDOG <br> Sheepdog... standing in the rain <br> Bullfrog... doing it again <br> Some kind of happiness <br> is measured out in miles <br> What makes you think you're <br> something special when you smile? <br> Childlike... no one understands <br> Jack knife... in your sweaty hands <br> Some kind of innocence <br> is measured out in years <br> You don't know what it's like <br> to listen to your fears <br> You can talk to me <br> You can talk to me <br> You can talk to me <br> If you're lonely you can talk to me <br> Big man... walking in the park <br> Wigwam... frightened of the dark <br> Some kind of solitude <br> is measured out in you <br> You think you know me <br> but you haven't got a clue <br> You can talk to me, <br> You can talk to me <br> You can talk to me... <br> if you're lonely you can talk to me <br> Hey, bulldog (x4) <br> Page 47 <br> John to the dog: <br> What do you say? Sing it. <br> Do you know any more? Play it! <br> Todos <br> Hey, bulldog. <br> The Beatles escape from the dog and the guards. Ringo finds Jeremy hanging from <br> the branch of a tree. <br> RINGO <br> Jeremy, can it be you? <br> JEREMY <br> Can it be me? I think you'd better <br> inquire of the guards, <br> for when I was captured, <br> they took all my cards. <br> RINGO <br> Shh, that's enough, Jeremy. Come on, the whole world's being attacked. <br> JEREMY <br> What do you want me to do? <br> Do you recommend fisticuffs <br> versus the guard? <br> [With a fighting manual in his hand Jeremy challenges the guard ] <br> Oh, guard! Blue Meanio! <br> Left to the nostril, right uppercut, <br> right to the eyebrow, left to the gut. <br> Jeremy stumbles into a tree. An apple falls down and knocks out the meanie. Ringo <br> congratulates Jeremy. <br> RINGO <br> Jeremy! <br> JEREMY <br> Come on, Ringo! <br> The Chief treats to stem the rout. <br> CHIEF BLUE MEANIE <br> Get back! Get back! Once more unto the breach, dear Meanies! You're advancing <br> the wrong way! Retreat backwards! Get back there now! <br> The Chief is swept along. <br> CHIEF BLUE MEANIE <br> My kingdom for a horse! [Jeremy comes close to him] I think I'll tear him up into little <br> pieces. <br> Page 48 <br> JEREMY <br> He does, does he? <br> CHIEF <br> I think I'll make a blueburger out of him. <br> JEREMY <br> Ha-ha, I don't care what you think. <br> CHIEF <br> You don't, eh? We'll soon see about that. <br> JEREMY <br> He does in truth seem quite annoyed, <br> [Opens the manual] <br> some reference material <br> before I'm destroyed. <br> Where ground is soft most often grows, <br> Arise, arise, arouse, a rose. <br> [Suddenly, a rose arise in the Chief nose] <br> A rosy nose? <br> CHIEF <br> Speak your last piece! <br> JEREMY <br> Peace, peace, <br> supplant the doom and the gloom. <br> Turn off what is sour, <br> turn into a flower and bloom, bloom. <br> Ha-ha, bloom, ha-ha, bloom, <br> bloom, bloom... <br> A lot of pink roses cover the whole body of the Chief. He flees crazy. <br> RINGO <br> First time I saw that Nowhere Man, that nobody, I knew he was somebody. <br> JOHN <br> You're right. Hello there, blue people. Won't you join us? Buck up, and otherwise go <br> mingle. What do you say? <br> CHIEF <br> Max? <br> MAX <br> Your Blue... I mean your Newness! <br> CHIEF, takes some flowers <br> It's no longer a blue world, Max. Where could we go? <br> Page 49 <br> MAX <br> Argentina? <br> JOHN <br> Are you with us? Will you join? <br> CHIEF <br> Shall we? <br> MAX <br> No!... [Chief threatens to hit him] Yes, your Newness! <br> CHIEF, smiles <br> Yes, Max... <br> JEREMY, close to them <br> Yes. Oh, yes is a word with a glorious ring, <br> A true, universal, euphonious thing. <br> In genders embracing <br> and chasing of blues, <br> the very best word <br> for the whole world to use. Ha-ha! <br> CHIEF <br> Yes, let us mix, Max. I've never admitted it before, but my cousin is the Bluebird of <br> Happiness. <br> 1:24:41 THE BEATLES : IT'S ALL TOO MUCH <br> It's all too much <br> When I look into your eyes, <br> Your love is there for me <br> And the more I go inside, <br> the more there is to see <br> It's all too much for me to take <br> The love that's shining all around here <br> All the world is birthday cake, <br> So take a piece but not too much <br> Everybody dance. Jeremy and the Chief reconcile. The Chief cries of <br> emotion. <br> Nice to have the time <br> to take this opportunity <br> Time for me to look at you, <br> and you to look at me <br> It's all too much for me to see <br> The love that's shining all around you <br> Everywhere, it's what you make <br> For us to take, it's all too much <br> It's too much <br> Page 50 <br> 1:26:55 PAUL, RINGO, GEORGE AND JOHN IN PERSON <br> PAUL <br> Catchy tune, that. <br> RINGO <br> I can't seem to get it out of my head. <br> GEORGE <br> Then shake it. <br> RINGO <br> That's what we've been doing all night. <br> PAUL <br> Yeah, it was a great party. <br> GEORGE <br> And we brought back lots of lovely souvenirs.

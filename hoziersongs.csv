Almost (Sweet Music),"I came in from the outside, burnt out from a joyride <br> She likes to roll here in my ashes anyway <br> Played from the bedside is Stella by Starlight <br> That was my heart, the drums that start off night and day <br> The same kind of music haunts her bedroom <br> I'm almost me again, she's almost you <br> I wouldn't know where to start <br> Sweet music playin' in the dark <br> Be still my foolish heart <br> Don't ruin this on me <br> I wouldn't know where to start <br> Sweet music playin' in the dark <br> Be still my foolish heart <br> Don't ruin this on me <br> Tell me who and I'll be thanking 'em <br> The numbered lovers of Duke Ellington <br> Do I owe each kiss to lip and cheek as soft as Chet can sing? <br> Let's get lost and let the good times roll <br> Let smoke rings from this paper doll <br> Blow sweet and thick 'til every thought of it don't mean a thing <br> I got some colour back, she thinks so, too <br> I laugh like me again, she laughs like you <br> I wouldn't know where to start <br> Sweet music playin' in the dark <br> Be still my foolish heart <br> Don't ruin this on me <br> I wouldn't know where to start <br> Sweet music playin' in the dark <br> Be still my foolish heart  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> Don't ruin this on me <br> I wouldn't know where <br> I wouldn't know where <br> I wouldn't know where, I wouldn't know where <br> I wouldn't <br> I wouldn't know where <br> I wouldn't know where <br> I wouldn't know where, I wouldn't know where <br> I wouldn't know <br> The very thought of you and am I blue <br> A love supreme seems far removed <br> I get along without you very well some other nights <br> Oh the radio newsreader chimes <br> Reporting Russian lullabies <br> She'll turn to me, awake, and ask, 'Is everything alright?' <br> And, Lord, I wouldn't know where to start <br> Sweet music playin' in the dark <br> Be still my foolish heart <br> Don't ruin this on me <br> I wouldn't know where to start (I wouldn't know where) <br> Sweet music playin' in the dark (I wouldn't know where) <br> Be still my foolish heart <br> Don't ruin this on me <br> I wouldn't know where to start (I wouldn't know where) <br> Sweet music playin' in the dark (I wouldn't know where) <br> Be still my foolish heart <br> Don't ruin this on me <br> I wouldn't know where to start (I wouldn't know where) <br> Sweet music playin' in the dark (I wouldn't know where) <br> Be still my foolish heart <br> Don't ruin this on me"

Angel Of Small d**h & The Codeine Scene,"I watch the work of my kin bold and boyful <br> Toying somewhere between love and abuse <br> Calling to join them the wretched and joyful <br> Shaking the wings of their terrible youths <br> Freshly dissolved in some frozen devotion <br> No more alone or myself could I be <br> Looks like a strain to the arms it were open <br> No shortage of sordid, no protest from me <br> [Chorus] <br> With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean <br> She's the angel of small d**h and the codeine scene <br> With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> She's the angel of small d**h and the codeine scene <br> Feeling more human and hooked on her flesh I <br> Lay my heart down with the rest at her feet <br> Fresh from the fields, all feeder and fur tires <br> Bloody and raw, but I swear it is sweet <br> [Chorus] <br> And lease this confusion, I'll wander the concrete <br> Wonder if better now having survived <br> Jarring of judgement and reasons defeat <br> The sweet heat of her breath in my mouth I'm alive <br> [Chorus]"
Arsonist's Lullaby,"[humming] <br> When I was a child, I heard voices... <br> Some would sing and some would scream <br> You soon find you have few choices.. <br> I learned the voices died with me <br> When I was a child I'd sit for hours <br> Staring into open flames <br> Something in it - had a power, <br> Could barely tear my eyes away <br> All you have is your fire... <br> And the place you need to reach - <br> Don't you ever, tame your demons <br> But always keep them on a leash <br> [humming] <br> When I was 16 my senses fooled me <br> Thought gasoline was on my clothes  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> I knew that something would always rule me... <br> I knew this sin was mine alone <br> All you have is your fire <br> And the place you need to reach <br> Don't you ever, tame your demons - <br> Always keep them on a leash <br> When I was a man I thought it ended <br> Well I knew loves perfect ache <br> But my peace has always depended <br> On all the ashes in my way <br> All you have is your fire, <br> And the place you need to reach <br> Don't you ever, tame your demons, <br> Always keep them on a leash..."
As It Was,"There is a roadway <br> Muddy and foxgloved <br> Whenever I'd had life enough <br> My heart is screaming of <br> And in a few days <br> I will be there, love <br> Whatever here that's left of me <br> Is yours just as it was <br> Just as it was, baby <br> Before the otherness came <br> And I knew its name <br> The drug, the dark, <br> The light, the flame <br> The highs hit the heights of my baby <br> And its hold had the fight of my baby <br> And the lights were as bright as my baby <br> But your love was unmoved <br> Tell me if somehow <br> Some of it remains <br> How long you would wait for me <br> How long I've been away  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> The shape that I'm in now <br> Your shape in the doorway <br> Make your good love known to me <br> Or just tell me about your day <br> Just as it was, baby <br> Before the otherness came <br> And I knew its name <br> The drug, the dark, <br> The light, the shame <br> The highs hit the heights of my baby <br> And its hold had the fight of my baby <br> And the lights were as bright as my baby <br> But your love was unmoved <br> And the sights were as stark as my baby <br> And the cold cut as sharp as my baby <br> And the nights were as dark as my baby <br> Half as beautiful too"

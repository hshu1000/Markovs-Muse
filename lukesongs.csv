A Long Way,"Six beers, five guys <br> And if I remember right <br> It was a Wednesday when we got our buzz off <br> A second-hand six pack <br> Half smoked, soft pack <br> Light it up, boys take a drag <br> And when I fought that cough off everyone else thought <br> I was so damn cool <br> My head was spinning like a tilt-a-whirl <br> Yeah man it really rocked my world <br> Back when things seemed just a little bit stronger <br> Back when the weekend lasted a little bit longer <br> Can't tell you why they did but things seemed to never end back then <br> Oh, way back when <br> When a little went a long way <br> One girl, and 45 <br> Bucks was all it took that night <br> Hit the steak house, make-out in the movies <br> Way up in the back <br> Credits roll, on pace  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> To make it all the way to second base <br> Tried to play it cool like it was nothing new <br> And she didn't have clue <br> That my head was spinning like a tilt-a-whirl <br> Yeah man she really rocked my world <br> Back when things seemed just a little bit stronger <br> Back when the weekend lasted a little bit longer <br> Can't tell you why they did but things seemed to never end back then <br> Oh, way back when <br> When a little went a long way <br> Back when things seemed just a little bit stronger <br> Back when the weekend lasted a little bit longer <br> Can't tell you why they did but things seemed to never end back then <br> Oh way back when, when a little went a long long way, oh <br> A long way"

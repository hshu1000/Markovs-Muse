Blank Space (Voice Memo),"So this next clip is, uh, from a session that I had with Max Martin and Johan Shellback and what we like to do is we like to run, um, a recording on our phones of everything we're doing when we're putting a song together, just in case one of us blurts out a cool melody and then we forget about it, we want to go back and then-and replay the tape so that we can remind ourselves what exactly we were saying. Um, so I brought in this idea called ""Blank Space,"" and this was me playing it for Max and Johan for the first time and they're shouting out these production ideas like, you know the ""Oh!"" at the beginning of the chorus, um, and that ended up in the song. So, this is the very beginning stages of the song on the album called ""Blank Space.""  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> ""Nice to meet you, where you been? <br> I could show you incredible things..."""

Fifteen,"[Verse 1] <br> You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors <br> It's the morning of your very first day <br> You say hi to your friends you haven't seen in a while <br> Try and stay out of everybody's way <br> It's your freshman year and you're going to be here <br> For the next four years in this town <br> Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say <br> ""You know, I haven't seen you around before"" <br> [Chorus] <br> Because when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you <br> You're going to believe them <br> And when you're fifteen feeling like there's nothing to figure out <br> Well, count to ten, take it in <br> This is life before you know who you're going to be <br> Fifteen <br> [Verse 2] <br> You sit in cla** next to a redhead named Abigail <br> And soon enough you're best friends <br> Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool <br> We'll be outta here as soon as we can <br> And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car <br> And you're feeling like flying <br> And you're momma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one <br> And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends <br> When the night ends  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> [Chorus] <br> Because when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you <br> You're going to believe them <br> When you're fifteen and your first kiss <br> Makes your head spin 'round <br> But in your life you'll do things greater than <br> Dating the boy on the football team <br> But I didn't know it at fifteen <br> [Verse 3] <br> When all you wanted was to be wanted <br> Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now <br> Back then I swore I was going to marry him someday <br> But I realized some bigger dreams of mine <br> And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy <br> Who changed his mind and we both cried <br> [Chorus] <br> Because when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you <br> You're going to believe them <br> And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall <br> I've found time can heal most anything <br> And you just might find who you're supposed to be <br> I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen <br> La la la la la la la la la la <br> La la la la la la la la la la <br> La la la la la la <br> [Outro] <br> Your very first day <br> Take a deep breath girl <br> Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors"
Firefly,"Someone struck a match against the night <br> All I could see was you and I <br> I was captivated <br> A perfect little dream inside my head <br> And then reality crept in, and erased it <br> For a while I thought that I could hold you <br> But you were just a temporary high <br> [Chorus] <br> Firefly you drew me to you <br> Your beauty shines and lights up the sky <br> And you don't know it, do you?  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> I wish I could keep you firefly <br> Firefly <br> Something so beautiful and free <br> Was as never meant to be caged in <br> I thought I had you in my hand <br> I tried to catch you, but I can't <br> Chase the wind <br> And just as I reach out to touch you <br> I remind myself you were meant to fly <br> [Chorus] <br> I like to think I'd be all that you wanted <br> Not even that is enough <br> [Chorus]"

I Know Places (Voice Memo),"So over the years, a lot of people have asked me to sort of describe my song writing process from beginning to end. How long does it take, where do you write, what are the circumstances, do you start with music, do you start with lyrics, and my answer is always that it happens differently every time, and that's why I'm still so in love with song writing. So what I've done here is shown you three different examples of the beginning stages of these songs and how they each started, different ways. So I'll explain them to you and maybe that will help you understand kind of how I put songs together <br> I sent this voice memo to Ryan Tedder because I'd always wanted to work with him, and finally we scheduled some studio time. So I always wanna be prepared. I wanted to send him the idea that I was working on before we went into the studio just in case he wrote back and said ""I can't stand that, I wanna work on something else, think of something else"". So I just sat down with the piano, put my phone on top of the piano and just kind of explained to him where I wanted to go with the song, how I saw the melody sitting in and we ended up recording the song the next day and it ended up being on the record called ""I Know Places"". So this was the voice memo I sent to him the night before we ended up finishing the song  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> ""Okay so this is kind of this rough idea thing: <br> Uh-uh-uh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i <br> Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i <br> Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i-i-i <br> Na na na na waiting at the back door <br> They're around and the vultures come around <br> And you know that they won't, they won't us <br> Say what they want 'bout, say what they want 'bout us <br> And you come and sing and listen <br> I would not think about it but I'm not done <br> Every know that a thing or two about it, thing or two about it, I <br> Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes <br> And guns <br> They are the hunters we are the foxes <br> And we run <br> Baby, I know places we won't be found <br> And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down <br> Cause I, I know places we can hide <br> I know places, I know places <br> Uh-uh-uh-i, uh-uh-uh-i, oh-oh-i, uh-uh-uh-i, no places <br> Or whatever I don't know, but that's basically just like a dark, really dark, lyric like bridge thing and it's about like everyone is trying to get into and ruin a love or whatever and it's like you just, whatever, you know, and the chorus would just go to that major and just be like ooh chorus.

I Wish You Would (Voice Memo),"This is another way I've written songs recently. This is a song I did with Jack Antonoff, and Jack is one of my friends and so were hanging out and he pulled out his phone and goes ""I made this amazing track the other day. It's so cool, I love these guitar sounds."" And he played it for me and immediately I could hear this finished song in my head, and I just said ""Please, please let me have that. Let me play with is, send it to me"". And so he sent it to me and I was on tour and this was me playing the track on my laptop recording me singing the vocal into my phone and it ended up being a song called ""I Wish You Would"", because Jack wrote back and said ""I love that"". So this is another way of writing, it's writing to track:  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> Okay so this is an idea called ""I Wish You Would"". It's kind of about this guy who's like, he's driving down the street at the middle of the night and he pa**es his ex-girlfriend's house and it's like, he thinks she hate him, but she's still in love with him, very dramatic. This track is sick, hope you like this <br> It's 2 am, in your car <br> Windows down, past my street the memories start <br> It's in the past <br> You drive straight ahead <br> You thinking that I hate you now <br> Cause you still don't know what I never said <br> I wish you would come back <br> Wish I never hung up the phone like I did <br> I wish you knew that <br> Do you like it!?"

You didn't know who I was before that. <br> Taylor: … that I can make these things happen and I have the ideas to do it and I create these things and concepts. And, like, I'm always gonna respect you. <br> Taylor: And I'm really glad you had the respect to call me and tell me that as a friend, about the song. It's just a really cool thing to do, and a really good show of friendship. So thank you. <br> Kanye: Thank you too. <br> Taylor: And you know, if people ask me about it, I think it would be great for me to be like, Look, he called me and told me about the line before it came out. Like, joke's on you guys, we're fine. <br> Taylor: You guys wanna call this a feud, you wanna call this throwing shade. But right after the song comes out I'm gonna be on a Grammy red carpet and they're gonna ask me about it and I'm gonna be like, he called me. <br> Taylor: …awesome that you're so outspoken and it's gonna be like, Yea, she does, it made her famous!

MTV VMAs 2015: Vanguard Acceptance Speech,"Bro. Bro. Listen to the kids. Jeremy, I need, I gotta put it down for a second. It's beautiful. Jeremy Scott's design. <br> First of all, thank you Taylor for being so gracious and giving me this award, this evening thank you. And I can think back to the first day I met you, also. You know. I think about, when I'm in the grocery store with my daughter, and I have a really great conversation about fresh juice and, you know. And at the end they say, ""Oh, you're not that bad after all."" And like, I think about it sometimes. Like, it crosses my mind a bit like when I go to a baseball game. And um, sixty thousand people boo me. Crosses my mind a little bit. And I think if I had to do it all again what would I have done? <br> Would I have worn a leather shirt? Would I have drank a half a bottle of Hennessy and gave the rest of it to the audience Y'all know y'all drink that bottle too. If I had a daughter at that time, would I have went on stage and grab the mic from someone else's? You know, this arena tomorrow, it's gonna be a completely different set up, some concert something like that. This stage will be gone, after that night, the stage is gone, but the effect that it had on people remain. <br> The, the problem was, the contradiction, the contradiction is, I do fight for artists, but in that fight I somehow, was disrespectful to artists. I-I didn't know how to say the right thing. The perfect thing. I just, I sat at the Grammy's and saw Justin Timberlake and Cee-Lo lose. Gnarls Barkley and the Future-Love... ""SexyBack"" album, and bro….Justin I ain't tryna put you on blast but I saw that man in tears, bro. You know, and I was thinking like, ""He deserve to win Album of the Year."" <br> And this small box that we are as the entertainers of the evening. How could you explain that? Sometimes I feel like, you know, all this sh** they run about beef and that, sometimes I feel like I died for an artist's opinion, for an artist to be able to have an opinion after they were successful. I'm not no politician bro. And look at that, you know how many times MTV ran that footage again, cause it got them more ratings? You know how many times they announced Taylor was gonna give me the award, cause it got them more ratings? Listen to the kids bro!  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> I still don't understand award shows, I don't understand how they get five people who work their entire life, won, sold records, sold concert tickets, to come stand on a carpet and for the first time in they live be judged on a chopping block and have the opportunity to be considered a loser. I don't understand it bro. I don't understand when the biggest album or the biggest video, I still don't understand it, I been conflicted bro, I just wanted people to like me more. But f** that bro! <br> Two thousand and fifteen. I will die for the art for what I believe in and the art ain't always gonna be polite. Y'all might be thinking right now, I wonder, did he smoke something before he came up here? The answer is yes, I rolled up a little something, I knocked the edge off. I don't know what's gonna happen tonight, I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow bro. <br> But all I can say to my artists, my fellow artists, just worry how you feel at the time man, just worry about how you feel and don't never, you know what I'm saying, I'm confident, I believe in myself. We the millennials bro, this is a new, this is a new mentality. We not gonna control our kids with brands. We're not gonna teach low self-esteem and hate to our kids, we're gonna teach our kids that they can be something. We gonna teach our kids that they can stand up for themselves. We gonna teach our kids to believe in themselves. If my grandfather was here right now, he would not let me back down. <br> I don't know what I'm finna lose after this. It don't matter though, it ain't about me, it's about ideas. People with new ideas. People who believe in truth. <br> And yes, as you probably could have guessed by this moment, I have decided in 2020, to run for President."

Taylor Swift Medley,"[Verse 1: AJ Rafael] <br> You were in college <br> Working part time waiting tables <br> Left a small town <br> Never look back <br> I was a flight risk with a fear of falling <br> Wondering why we bother with love <br> If it never lasts <br> [Pre-Chorus 1: Tori Kelly] <br> Cause' she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts <br> She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers <br> Dreaming 'bout the day when <br> You wake up and find that <br> What you're looking for has been here the whole time <br> [Chorus] <br> Cause' all I know is we said, ""Hello"" <br> And your eyes look like coming home <br> All I know is a simple name <br> Everything has changed <br> All I know is you held the door <br> You'll be mine and I'll be yours <br> All I know since yesterday is everything has changed <br> [Verse 2] <br> If you could see that <br> I'm the one who understands you <br> Been here all along <br> So why can't you see <br> You belong with me? <br> [Verse 3] <br> Drop everything now!  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> Meet me in the pouring rain <br> Kiss me on the sidewalk <br> Take away the pain <br> Cause' I see sparks fly whenever you smile <br> Get me with those green eyes, baby <br> As the lights go down <br> Give me something that'll haunt me <br> When you're not around <br> Cause' I see sparks fly whenever you smile <br> [Verse 4: 3x] <br> I just wanna know you better <br> Know you better <br> Know you better now <br> I just wanna know you, know you, know you <br> [Bridge] <br> We called it off again last night, but <br> This time I'm tellin' you <br> I'm tellin you <br> I knew you were trouble when you walked in <br> (We'll never, ever, ever) <br> I knew you were trouble when you walked in <br> (Getting back together) <br> You go talk to your friends <br> Talk to my friends <br> Talk to me, but <br> I knew you were trouble when you walked in <br> Never getting back together <br> [Outro] <br> But you are the best thing <br> That's ever been mine"
Taylor Swift Responds To Kanye's 'Famous' Lyric," <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> Search <br> Where is the video of Kanye telling me he was going to call me ‘that b**h' in his song? It doesn't exist because it never happened. You don't get to control someone's emotional response to being called ‘that b**h' in front of the entire world. Of course I wanted to like the song. I wanted to believe Kanye when he told me that I would love the song. I wanted us to have a friendly relationship. He promised to play the song for me, but he never did. While I wanted to be supportive of Kanye on the phone call, you cannot ‘approve' a song you haven't heard. Being falsely painted as a liar when I was never given the full story or played any part of the song is character a**a**ination. I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative, one that I have never asked to be a part of, since 2009."

The Future of Music Is a Love Story,"Where will the music industry be in 20 years, 30 years, 50 years? <br> Before I tell you my thoughts on the matter, you should know that you're reading the opinion of an enthusiastic optimist: one of the few living souls in the music industry who still believes that the music industry is not dying…it's just coming alive <br> There are many (many) people who predict the downfall of music sales and the irrelevancy of the album as an economic entity. I am not one of them. In my opinion, the value of an album is, and will continue to be, based on the amount of heart and soul an artist has bled into a body of work, and the financial value that artists (and their labels) place on their music when it goes out into the marketplace. Piracy, file sharing and streaming have shrunk the numbers of paid album sales drastically, and every artist has handled this blow differently <br> In recent years, you've probably read the articles about major recording artists who have decided to practically give their music away, for this promotion or that exclusive deal. My hope for the future, not just in the music industry, but in every young girl I meet…is that they all realize their worth and ask for it <br> Music is art, and art is important and rare. Important, rare things are valuable. Valuable things should be paid for. It's my opinion that music should not be free, and my prediction is that individual artists and their labels will someday decide what an album's price point is. I hope they don't underestimate themselves or undervalue their art Arrows Through the Heart In mentioning album sales, I'd like to point out that people are still buying albums, but now they're buying just a few of them. They are buying only the ones that hit them like an arrow through the heart or have made them feel strong or allowed them to feel like they really aren't alone in feeling so alone. It isn't as easy today as it was 20 years ago to have a multiplatinum-selling album, and as artists, that should challenge and motivate us <br> There are always going to be those artists who break through on an emotional level and end up in people's lives forever. The way I see it, fans view music the way they view their relationships. Some music is just for fun, a pa**ing fling (the ones they dance to at clubs and parties for a month while the song is a huge radio hit, that they will soon forget they ever danced to). Some songs and albums represent seasons of our lives, like relationships that we hold dear in our memories but had their time and place in the past <br> However, some artists will be like finding ""the one."" We will cherish every album they put out until they retire and we will play their music for our children and grandchildren. As an artist, this is the dream bond we hope to establish with our fans. I think the future still holds the possibility for this kind of bond, the one my father has with the Beach Boys and the one my mother has with Carly Simon <br> I think forming a bond with fans in the future will come in the form of constantly providing them with the element of surprise. No, I did not say ""shock""; I said ""surprise."" I believe couples can stay in love for decades if they just continue to surprise each other, so why can't this love affair exist between an artist and their fans?  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> In the YouTube generation we live in, I walked out onstage every night of my stadium tour last year knowing almost every fan had already seen the show online. To continue to show them something they had never seen before, I brought out dozens of special guest performers to sing their hits with me. My generation was raised being able to flip channels if we got bored, and we read the last page of the book when we got impatient. We want to be caught off guard, delighted, left in awe. I hope the next generation's artists will continue to think of inventive ways of keeping their audiences on their toes, as challenging as that might be <br> There are a few things I have witnessed becoming obsolete in the past few years, the first being autographs. I haven't been asked for an autograph since the invention of the iPhone with a front-facing camera. The only memento ""kids these days"" want is a selfie. It's part of the new currency, which seems to be ""how many followers you have on Instagram."" Fan Power A friend of mine, who is an actress, told me that when the casting for her recent movie came down to two actresses, the casting director chose the actress with more Twitter followers. I see this becoming a trend in the music industry. For me, this dates back to 2005 when I walked into my first record-label meetings, explaining to them that I had been communicating directly with my fans on this new site called Myspace. In the future, artists will get record deals because they have fans—not the other way around <br> Another theme I see fading into the gray is genre distinction. These days, nothing great you hear on the radio seems to come from just one musical influence. The wild, unpredictable fun in making music today is that anything goes. Pop sounds like hip hop; country sounds like rock; rock sounds like soul; and folk sounds like country—and to me, that's incredible progress. I want to make music that reflects all of my influences, and I think that in the coming decades the idea of genres will become less of a career-defining path and more of an organizational tool <br> This moment in music is so exciting because the creative avenues an artist can explore are limitless. In this moment in music, stepping out of your comfort zone is rewarded, and sonic evolution is not only accepted…it is celebrated. The only real risk is being too afraid to take a risk at all Celebrity Spotlight I predict that some things will never change. There will always be an increasing fixation on the private lives of musicians, especially the younger ones. Artists who were at their commercial peak in the '70s, '80s and '90s tell me, ""It was never this crazy for us back then!"" And I suspect I'll be saying that same thing to younger artists someday (God help them). There continues to be a bad girl vs. good girl/clean-cut vs. s**y debate, and for as long as those labels exist, I just hope there will be contenders on both sides. Everyone needs someone to relate to <br> And as for me? I'll just be sitting back and growing old, watching all of this happen or not happen, all the while trying to maintain a life rooted in this same optimism <br> And I'd also like a nice garden"

The Moment I Knew,"You should've been there, <br> Should've burst through the door, <br> With that 'baby I'm right here' smile, <br> And it would've felt like, <br> A million little shining stars had just aligned, <br> And I would've been so happy. <br> Christmas lights glisten, <br> I've got my eye on the door, <br> Just waiting for you to walk in, <br> But the time is ticking, <br> People ask me how I've been <br> As I comb back through my memory, <br> How you said you'd be here, <br> You said you'd be here. <br> And it was like slow motion, <br> Standing there in my party dress, <br> In red lipstick, <br> With no one to impress, <br> And they're all laughing, <br> As I'm looking around the room, <br> But there's one thing missing, <br> And that was the moment I knew. <br> And the hours pa** by, <br> Now I just wanna be alone, <br> But your close friends always seem to know <br> When there's something really wrong, <br> So they follow me down the hall, <br> And there in the bathroom, <br> I try not to fall apart, <br> And the sinking feeling starts,  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> As I say hopelessly, <br> ""He said he'd be here."" <br> And it was like slow motion, <br> Standing there in my party dress, <br> In red lipstick, <br> With no one to impress, <br> And they're all laughing, <br> And asking me about you, <br> But there's one thing missing, <br> And that was the moment I knew. <br> What do you say <br> When tears are streaming down your face <br> In front of everyone you know? <br> And what do you do when the one <br> Who means the most to you <br> Is the one who didn't show? <br> You should've been here. <br> And I would've been so happy. <br> And it was like slow motion, <br> Standing there in my party dress, <br> In red lipstick, <br> With no one to impress, <br> And they're all standing around me singing <br> ""Happy birthday to you"", <br> But there's one thing missing, <br> And that was the moment I knew. <br> Ooh, I knew. <br> You call me later, <br> And say, ""I'm sorry, I didn't make it,"" <br> And I say, ""I'm sorry too,"" <br> And that was the moment I knew."

"To Apple, Love Taylor","I write this to explain why I'll be holding back my album, 1989, from the new streaming service, Apple Music. I feel this deserves an explanation because Apple has been and will continue to be one of my best partners in selling music and creating ways for me to connect with my fans. I respect the company and the truly ingenious minds that have created a legacy based on innovation and pushing the right boundaries. <br> I'm sure you are aware that Apple Music will be offering a free 3 month trial to anyone who signs up for the service. I'm not sure you know that Apple Music will not be paying writers, producers, or artists for those three months. I find it to be shocking, disappointing, and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous company. <br> This is not about me. Thankfully I am on my fifth album and can support myself, my band, crew, and entire management team by playing live shows. This is about the new artist or band that has just released their first single and will not be paid for its success. This is about the young songwriter who just got his or her first cut and thought that the royalties from that would get them out of debt. This is about the producer who works tirelessly to innovate and create, just like the innovators and creators at Apple are pioneering in their field…but will not get paid for a quarter of a year's worth of plays on his or her songs.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> These are not the complaints of a spoiled, petulant child. These are the echoed sentiments of every artist, writer and producer in my social circles who are afraid to speak up publicly because we admire and respect Apple so much. We simply do not respect this particular call. <br> I realize that Apple is working towards a goal of paid streaming. I think that is beautiful progress. We know how astronomically successful Apple has been and we know that this incredible company has the money to pay artists, writers and producers for the 3 month trial period… even if it is free for the fans trying it out. <br> Three months is a long time to go unpaid, and it is unfair to ask anyone to work for nothing. I say this with love, reverence, and admiration for everything else Apple has done. I hope that soon I can join them in the progression towards a streaming model that seems fair to those who create this music. I think this could be the platform that gets it right. <br> But I say to Apple with all due respect, it's not too late to change this policy and change the minds of those in the music industry who will be deeply and gravely affected by this. We don't ask you for free iPhones. Please don't ask us to provide you with our music for no compensation. <br> Taylor"

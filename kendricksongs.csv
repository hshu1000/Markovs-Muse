Comments on 2014 Grammys," <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> On Macklemore winning best rap album <br> It's well deserved; he did what he did, man. He went out there and hustled and grinded. Everything happens for a reason; the universe comes back around, that's how it go. <br> On the Grammys snubbing him entirely <br> I definitely feel like they should always have more of the culture up in there, for sure, because we definitely stand out just like any other genre. We part of the world. We part of the movement. So I think any awards, including the Grammys, should always push for more hip-hop because it's music as a whole, it's not just splitting different regions. Everything moves as far as sound and vibrations, and that's how it goes. And we are a part of that."

So until we come back to these commandments, until you come back to these commandments, we're gonna be in this place, we're gonna be under this curse. Because he said he's gonna punish us, the so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians, are the true children of Israel. We are the Israelites according to the Bible. The children of Israel, he's gonna punish us for our inequities. For our disobedience because we chose to follow other gods that aren't his son, so the Lord thy God chasten you. So just like your children, your own son, he's gonna chastise you because he loves you. So that's why we get chastised, that's why we're in the position we're in. Until we come back to these laws, statutes and commandments, and do what the Lord said, these curses are gonna be upon us.

God Is Gangsta - Short Film,"-- TIMELINE -- *** PART 1: U *** [Credits - 'U'] <br> (1) Transitional Slide - 'U' <br> Scene 1: Screams <br> (00:00 - 00:30) <br> With the opening screams the audience can also sense that something is eerie; these sounds are in the original track combined creating a dangerous visual. Then beginning to see Kendrick pouring his heart out in to his liquor in a schizophrenic manner. <br> Scene 2: The Hotel Room <br> (00:30 - 01:26) <br> Hearing the chorus ""Loving you is complicated"" - the image starts to depict that there is an internal struggle going on with him loving himself. The scene is immensely minimalistic and filled with dark lighting, this accompanied by his throne like chair creates for a deep setting for imagery to take a place in the film. <br> Scene 3: Mirror <br> (01:27 - 01:57) <br> The mirror representative of an internal reflection; as the struggle of how he views himself as the words utter ""I ****** tell you, you ****** failure—you ain't no leader!"", the negatively intrinsic views we beginnings to see why he hates himself for the mistakes he has made. <br> Scene 4: Tipsy <br> (01:57 - 02:10) <br> Stumbling all over the place into his throne - blurred visions of the camera shaking around giving us P.O.V. (Point of Vision) of what it is like to be overly intoxicated. <br> Scene 5: Room Service <br> The skit from 'u' begins to play before we hear the drunk Lamar entering in the next scene. Dialogue Effect on the Audience <br> (2) Transitional Slide - '8' <br> Scene 6 Part 1: Spinning Bottle <br> (02:37 - 03:42) <br> A very unique and a extremely interesting shot with a spinning bottle in the back ground seemingly to play spin the bottle by himself. <br> Notice this high angle shot focusing down on Lamar with a demonic reflection in the background of the mirror choosing to do it's own thing every now and then. <br> Scene 6 Part 2: Smashed Mirror <br> (03:30 - 03:42) <br> An easily missed technique of a reflection of himself breaking the mirror of reality down, smashing into pieces before the screen goes black into the next slide. <br> (3) Transitional Slide - 'Clearance sale: 100% off' *** PART 2: For Sale *** [Credits - 'For Sale'] <br> Scene 1: The Dunk <br> (03:43 - 07:11) <br> A symbolistic baptism that takes Kendrick under thats meant to cleanse him from his impurities and sins of the night to be reborn again. This scene is a complete contrast from Scene 2 which compliments to criticism of the hip hop industry in ""For Sale"". <br> (4) Transitional Slide - 'Life is like a box of chickens'  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> (5) Transitional Slide - 'Instagram 2016: Dussy unlimited' <br> (6) Transitional Slide - 'If I blame you for a loss, I'll be giving you all the credit' <br> (7) Transitional Slide - 'Good dussy can make you melt' <br> Scene 2: Lust <br> (04:03) <br> 'Lucy's' temptations are all around Kendrick whether it's smoking weed, making him famous or filling his pockets with money these comparisons are depicted through the naked women in scene. <br> (8) Transitional Slide - 'Always trust a n**** with cornrows' <br> Scene 3: Lost/Distractions <br> (04:10) <br> It seems like Kendrick is trying to keep focus and maintain what is important to him, looking unaware and lost he is staring into the same place not noticing the women and putting aside these distractions. (9) Transitional Slide - 'Time is change, your friend or foe' <br> (10) Transitional Slide - 'Never trust a n**** with too many haircuts' <br> (11) Transitional Slide - 'Tracee Ellis Ross is vibrant' <br> Scene 4: Demonic Eyes <br> (04:24 - 04:38) <br> Seducing Kendrick into these sinful acts seeming to illustrate a lucifer idea or connection - depicted through the lighting, eyes and the heads tilt provides an uncomfortable mood for the audience. Scene 5: Upside Down <br> (04:39) <br> *Conscious speaking* (12) Transitional Slide - 'I made money, I lost money, I did it again' <br> (13) Transitional Slide - 'Dussy salary cap' <br> (14) Transitional Slide - 'Water dawg' <br> (15) Transitional Slide - 'I followed your rules for way too long' <br> (16) Transitional Slide - 'Night like this I wish that bomb head would fall' <br> Scene 6: Bridge <br> (05:59 - 06:09) <br> This scene makes little sense in the film and stands out like a sore thumb and really questions the audience about what is happening. <br> Scene 7: Trapped <br> (00:00 - 00:00) <br> How the industry strips you down for what you have got like strippers and take your money and keep you trapped in their vicious cycle. (17) Transitional Slide - 'My tastebloods is expensive' <br> Scene 8: Waking up <br> (00:00 - 00:00) <br> *Waking up out of it?

"Good kid, m.A.A.d city Album Review","The first sound we hear on good kid, m.A.A.d. city is a prayer: ""Thank you, Lord Jesus, for saving us with your precious blood,"" voices murmur, evoking a family dinner gathering. The album's cover art, a grubby Polaroid, provides a visual prompt for the scene: Baby Kendrick dangles off an uncle's knee in front of a squat kitchen table displaying a 40-ounce and Lamar's baby bottle. The snapshot is such an unvarnished peek into the rapper's inner life that staring at it for too long feels almost invasive. This autobiographical intensity is the album's calling card. Listening to it feels like walking directly into Lamar's childhood home and, for the next hour, growing up alongside him. <br> Lamar has subtitled the record ""A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar"", and the comparison rings true: You could take the album's outline and build a set for a three-act play. It opens on a 17-year-old Kendrick ""with nothing but p**y stuck on my mental,"" driving his mother's van to see a girl named Sherane. As his voice darts and halts in a rhythm that mimics his over-eager commute, Lamar explores the furtiveness of young lust: ""It's deep-rooted, the music of being young and dumb,"" he raps. The song is interrupted by the first of several voice mail recordings that delineate the album's structure: Kendrick's mother, rambling into his phone and pleading for him to return her car. These voicemails appear through the record, reinforcing that good kid, m.A.A.d city is partly a love letter to the grounding power of family. In this album's world, family and faith are not abstract concepts: They are the fraying tethers holding Lamar back from the chasm of gang violence that threatens to consume him. <br> All this weighty material might make good kid, m.A.A.d city sound like a bit of a drag. But the miracle of this album is how it ties straightforward rap thrills-- dazzling lyrical virtuosity, slick quotables, pulverizing beats, star turns from guest rappers-- directly to its narrative. For example, when ""Backseat Freestyle"" leaked last week, its uncharacteristic subject matter (""All my life I want money and power/ Respect my mind or die from lead shower"") took some fans by surprise. But on the album, it marks the moment in the narrative when young Kendrick's character first begins rapping, egged on by a friend who plugs in a beat CD. Framed this way, his ""damn, I got b**hes"" chant gets turned inside out: This isn't an alpha male's boast. It's a pipsqueak's first pa** at a chest-puff. It's also a monster of a radio-ready single, with Kendrick rapping in three voices (in double- and triple-time, no less) over an insane Hit-Boy beat. <br> Lamar grew up in Compton, and ghosts of West Coast gangsta-rap haunt this album's edges, casting shadows on Kendrick's complicated relationship with his hometown. When ""The Art of Peer Pressure"" brings Kendrick and his friends to Rosecrans Ave., the music downshifts into menacing G-funk mode as a salute to hallowed ground. Ice Cube's “Bird in the Hand” is invoked to set up “m.A.A.d city” (“Fresh of out school, 'cause I was a high-school grad...""), which appropriately marks the moment when real violence erupts. Here, Kendrick sounds like a terrified kid: ""I made a promise to see you bleeding,"" he raps, his voice pitched at a pleading, near-hysterical sob. In response, the voice of Compton's Most Wanted rapper MC Eiht leers, ""Wake yo' punk a** up,"" like a father figure of the Darth Vader variety.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> Which brings us to the album's most visible benefactor and most unsettled presence: Dr. Dre. In recent months, Dre has availed himself of the fresh-career oxygen Kendrick's rise has pumped into his atmosphere, lumbering out of his corporate airlock to stand with Lamar on magazine covers. But the role he plays in Lamar's story feels muddled and unresolved. On an album that manages to seamlessly work a smirking Drake and a highly recognizable Janet Jackson sample (""Poetic Justice"") into the fabric of a larger narrative, it is only Dre's appearance, on the final track ""Compton"", that feels like an uneasy outlier. <br> ""Compton"" is the victory lap, the coronation. Coming after the stunning 12-minute denouement ""Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst"", in which Lamar delivers a verse from a peripheral character that is the album's most dazzling stroke of empathy, it can't help but be a small deflation. The moment of arrival in any artist's story is always less interesting than their journey, and there's a disconnect in hearing Lamar and Dre stunt over Just Blaze's blaring orchestral-soul beat. Dre's music is part of the landscape that Kendrick grew up in but his actual appearance has a certain Truman Show feel to it. <br> But the true ending of good kid, m.A.A.d. city takes place at the end of the previous song, ""Real"", which represents the spiritual victory that the album's story has thrashed its way towards. Finally grasping that ""none of that sh**""-- money, power, respect, loving your block-- ""make me real,"" Lamar embraces what does, as his parents put the album's central concerns to bed: ""Any n***a can k** a man,"" his father admonishes. ""That don't make you a real n***a. Real is responsibility. Real is taking care of your motherf**ing family."" And his mother: ""If I don't hear from you by tomorrow, I hope you come back and learn from your mistakes. Come back a man... Tell your story to these black and brown kids in Compton...

"Hot 97 Interview on ""Control""","On the response to the line ""I'm the king of New York"": <br> It made me go back here and feel like I probably gotta dumb down my lyrics nowadays, for people to take it way out of context the way they did… The main heads that really understood the context of the line was the actual kings of New York, the cats that I sat down with this past week. They're not understanding that it's not about the culture, it's not about what side we on, it's about being great as Biggie, as Pac, the two cats that I referenced… I feel like I'm a student. I'm a student of the work that they did. When I put down 20 years in the game, I can eventually plant my foot and have that same type of legacy… I never take the history behind what Pac laid or what BIG laid. <br> On Kendrick's king of rap, Snoop Dogg: <br> To keep it 100 with you, Snoop will always be number one, and I'm from the West Coast, and he gave me that. But out of respect for my big homie, I understand it. He laid down. I only got one album out homie. One album out. I got years to be doing this. At the end of the day, Snoop will always be my big homie and the legends that came before me they will always stand tall where they're at. But I can't stop myself from wanting to be great just like them.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> On East/West rivalry in 2013: <br> I feel as though you have certain cats that are really gonna take it to the next level and make it a rivalry thing and try to bring back that whole thing. No that's old school homie. We black men out here trying to uplift the culture. My first sold out show was in New York…I respect the legends in the game. I respect people that done it before me, people that lost their lives over this. Because of what they laid down, I'm gonna try to go ten times harder and breathe it and live it. That's the point of the whole verse, what I was trying to convey through that verse. All the ignorance behind it, you can k** that noise. It'll never be like that again, two coast rivalry.

Interview: Kendrick Lamar,"Kendrick Lamar stopped by FADER offices recently in support of his major label debut, good kid, m.A.A.d city, out October 22nd on Aftermath/Interscope/Top Dawg. He declined to empty his pockets for a Things I Carry (“I've just got my license and a little money…”), but opened up about Barack Obama, being labeled a “conscious rapper” and Top Dawg Entertainment, the tight-knit label where he and the Black Hippy crew came up. <br> FADER: So tell us about the album. <br> Kendrick Lamar: It's really just a self portrait. I feel like everything that people have asked me in interviews should be explained in this one album. How I'm able to think the way I think now—it had to come from a negative place first. Family issues, morals. All that is in one debut. I feel like it's a whole new market of people that's listening to me now, so it's almost like a reintroduction to who I am and furthering that longevity. <br> F: Has being on a major label made things easier for you? <br> KL: It's really just the same procedure. I'm still with this Top Dawg Entertainment company and we already ran this company like a major. Top Dawg: four individual kids off the streets, man, and really just gave them a domain to do something positive. We always did the work. We understood that if we wanted to be amongst the elite, we gotta conduct ourselves. So us joining forces with Interscope is basically a continuance of that, giving us an opportunity to do something constructive with ourselves, and the most positive high ever. <br> F: How's it going with everybody? Ab-Soul's album seems like it did well. <br> KL: I think every artist on the label is in a great space. We never wanted to present it as only one main artist in the camp. We wanted to solidify everybody as their own individual. That's what's happening now. You see Schoolboy Q's taking off. [Jay] Rock already been there and still working. Ab-Soul. Everybody's making their own lane and their own path to where people can't look at it as if Top Dawg Entertainment is Kendrick Lamar. It's all of us as a collective that's representing this company. Stream: Kendrick Lamar, “Backseat Freestyle” (Prod. by Hit-Boy) F: The album looks like a picture of you as a baby at a house party. What's the story behind that picture? <br> KL: I think the people that'll really understand the cover and the significance of every little piece in the portraits is people that's been rocking with me since day one. Those are real portraits. They'll understand what that means way before they hear the album. I'm sure that paints a big, big picture of what I represent, coming from this place, but it's what I've been talking about, the lifestyle and putting a positive light on it at the end of the day. <br> F: That runs through so much of your music, this uplifting spin on things. <br> KL: There's so much negativity in the world today. People know what's real and know what's fake. They know who really lived it and who's trying to live it. That's what I think people rock with me genuinely, because they know I'm not out here trying to glorify certain situations through these records or say I'm the biggest k**er in the world. I don't believe in none of these rappers anyway. The real gangsters, you never really see their faces because they're either in the ground, in prison or behind the scenes.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> F: What is people's biggest misconception about you? <br> KL: Early on, when I started really getting attention, I seen a lot of blogs and a lot of media try to cla**ify my music as one particular thing. That was like the “conscious” thing. It's crazy, because they define it after just one project, certain things I was talking about. I never wanted that. I never want people to cla**ify my music. That went out the window once I dropped a record called “Ignorance Is Bliss.” It was street, it was West Coast, it was a little bit more wisdom, and a person can't really fake that. They figured out it wasn't just the introspective side. At the end of the day, I want people to recognize me as just a human being, period. I talk about whatever I feel and whatever I go through. <br> F: What makes you happiest right now? <br> KL: It's a few things. One, this influence I have on my community, on my city. I'm doing something in a positive light for these kids out here. A few of my homeboys, they're locked up, they got kids and they're going straight to jail as soon as they have these babies. Their sons, they're five, six years old now. They're looking at me to do something different. Their fathers respect that. So when their kid can see me on TV and get excited about it and know that I came from the same place they came from, that's a great feeling to accomplish. That's definitely a great feeling because I know it's gonna start from that small place, that community in Compton, and eventually speed around the world. I wanna spark that idea in my own backyard first. <br> F: In another interview recently that you said you don't vote. Has anyone given you a hard time for saying that? <br> KL: No. It was my own personal opinion and they know I'm true to myself. I'm not knocking the kids not to go out there and do it. Do it and get that experience. I gained that experience, it's just a personal thing within myself and where I'm at in my life and how I feel about the world and spiritually. It has nothing to do with Obama. I want Obama to get that spot because I know he has a good heart. It's just the people behind him. You have some people that say I'm in a space now where I disregard the people that are still struggling. That's bullcrap, because at the end of the day, I've been thinking the same way since I was 16 years old. My whole thing is: people always look at the high places to come back down and help these communities, but at the end of the day, it starts with the people that's in the communities. That's what I really wanna stress."

Introductory Speech (Kunta's Groove Sessions)," <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> [Backing Instrumental] <br> My day one motherf**ing fans in this building, one time. As I look around-this the sh**. I ain't been this intimate in a long time. We might be up here all motherf**ing night, I got something. I ain't seen y'all in a minute, real sh**. You know I mean it when I say, I been around the world and sh**. A whole sea of people. But nothing like coming right here in front of this small group. The people that's been with me since day one. Kendrick Lamar EP. Kendrick Lamar OD. Section-mothef**ing-.80. Real sh**. This is cool right here goddamn, this is really cool right now. This about real sh**, listen up. To Pimp a bu*terfly. People said a lot about this album. That'd said album of the year, that' said album of this generation and all that sh**. That's cool, but also real sh** making this motherf**ing album was therapy. Not only for you, but for me, You know what I'm saying? Because within six months of good kid, m.A.A.d city dropping, the life of what I knew, when I knew what it was, thinking I knew, that completely changed within six months. And uh, you going through the motional of the world telling you that you're great. And you trying to make yourself believe that sh**, but it's hard because you're institutionalized from where you come from. Still trying to move around and stay the way I like I do. I'm a low-key n***a. And I ain't scared of the world. Me personally, I can't run around with a hundred n***as like I usually do. I don't need to, I don't want to. And that's just been me since day one. So trying to grasp the idea of them telling you who you should run with, it can't cut it. Because like I said on the Kendrick Lamar EP, ""I need to be me goddamnit"". I think this sh** can live forever, but looking at y'all faces y'all just. I got some of the most loyal. dedicated motherf**ing fans in the world (?). (?) I could talk all day (?). To Pimp a bu*terfly. Y'all allowed this motherf**ing album has soared all the way to the top with no motherf**ing commercial success. Y'all allowed it to be top-tier without a constant radio single and sh**. So that proves to you right there, music is not something you can motherf**ing market all the time. This sh** belong to you and you only, you know what I'm saying? Some sh** that y'all can feel whether you insecure, whether you vulnerable, whether you mad, happy, angry, sad. You pop this motherf**ing tape in, you pop your favorite music in, and you love and you live that sh**. And you allow artists like me myself to come back to these group of people and perform the sh** that I want to perform, you dig what I'm saying? This may be the first and last time I perform To Pimp a bu*terfly on this run. Eight of the ten cities. And I made sure New York be one of them cities that I come back to to do this sh**. So with that being said, we gon' rock this sh** until the casket drop or until, until it all falls down. Let's go"

Other than that, now that I finally got a chance to holla at you, I always wanted to ask you about a certain situa--, about a metaphor actually, you spoke on the ground. What you mean ‘bout that, what the ground represent?  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> [2Pac] <br> The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil <br> [Kendrick Lamar] <br> Right <br> [2Pac] <br> That's how I see it, my word is bond. I see--and the ground is the symbol for the poor people, the poor people is gonna open up this whole world and swallow up the rich people. Cause the rich people gonna be so fat, they gonna be so appetising, you know what I'm saying, wealthy, appetising. The poor gonna be so poor and hungry, you know what I'm saying it's gonna be like… there might be some cannibalism out this mutha, they might eat the rich <br> [Kendrick Lamar] <br> Aight so let me ask you this then, do you see yourself as somebody that's rich or somebody that made the best of their own opportunities? <br> [2Pac] <br> I see myself as a natural born hustler, a true hustler in every sense of the word. I took nothin', I took the opportunities, I worked at the most menial and degrading job and built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it. I went from having somebody manage me to me hiring the person that works my management company. I changed everything I realized my destiny in a matter of five years you know what I'm saying I made myself a millionaire. I made millions for a lot of people now it's time to make millions for myself, you know what I'm saying. I made millions for the record companies, I made millions for these movie companies, now I make millions for us <br> [Kendrick Lamar] <br> And through your different avenues of success, how would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity? <br> [2Pac] <br> By my faith in God, by my faith in the game, and by my faith in ""all good things come to those that stay true."" You know what I'm saying, and it was happening to me for a reason, you know what I'm saying, I was noticing, sh**, I was punching the right bu*tons and it was happening. So it's no problem, you know I mean it's a problem but I'm not finna let them know. I'm finna go straight through <br> [Kendrick Lamar] <br> Would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall? <br> [2Pac] <br> sh**, I like to think that at every opportunity I've ever been threatened with resistance, it's been met with resistance. And not only me but it goes down my family tree. You know what I'm saying, it's in my veins to fight back <br> [Kendrick Lamar] <br> Aight well, how long you think it take before n***as be like, we fighting a war, I'm fighting a war I can't win and I wanna lay it all down <br> [2Pac] <br> In this country a black man only have like 5 years we can exhibit maximum strength, and that's right now while you a teenager, while you still strong or while you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back. Cause once you turn 30 it's like they take the heart and soul out of a man, out of a black man in this country. And you don't wanna fight no more. And if you don't believe me you can look around, you don't see no loud mouth 30-year old muthaf**as <br> [Kendrick Lamar] <br> That's crazy, because me being one of your offspring of the legacy you left behind I can truly tell you that there's nothing but turmoil goin' on so I wanted to ask you what you think is the future for me and my generation today? <br> [2Pac] <br> I think that n***as is tired of grabbin' sh** out the stores and next time it's a riot there's gonna be, like, uh, bloodshed for real. I don't think America know that. I think American think we was just playing and it's gonna be some more playing but it ain't gonna be no playing. It's gonna be murder, you know what I'm saying, it's gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831, up in this muthaf**a. You know what I'm saying, it's gonna happen <br> [Kendrick Lamar] <br> That's crazy man. In my opinion, only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations, lotta people don't understand how important it is. Sometimes I be like, get behind a mic and I don't know what type of energy I'mma push out, or where it comes from. Trip me out sometimes <br> [2Pac] <br> Because the spirits, we ain't even really rappin', we just letting our dead homies tell stories for us <br> [Kendrick Lamar] <br> Damn <br> I wanted to read one last thing to you. It's actually something a good friend had wrote describing my world. It says: <br> “The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it <br> Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it, in order to protect itself from this mad city <br> While consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive <br> One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him, but praises the bu*terfly <br> The bu*terfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness, and the beauty within the caterpillar <br> But having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the bu*terfly as weak and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits <br> Already surrounded by this mad city the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him <br> He can no longer see past his own thoughts <br> He's trapped <br> When trapped inside these walls certain ideas take roots, such as going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city <br> The result? <br> Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant <br> Finally free, the bu*terfly sheds light on situations that the caterpillar never considered, ending the internal struggle <br> Although the bu*terfly and caterpillar are completely different, they are one and the same."" <br> What's your perspective on that? <br> Pac?

Kendrick Lamar On Yeezus Tour,"My love for music, my pa**ion for it, you know that's my life, you know? It's not just a job for me, it's truly a lifestyle. I wake up, I think about or a verse, I go to sleep I'm thinking about it. I walk out, throughout my day, you know I think about music. <br> [Control instrumental plays] <br> During the Revolt interview, Lamar was also talked about the important role that music plays in his life today. <br> It's just something I breathe now, I didn't always breathe it. I always was a fan of it, but now I really live it. That's inspiration within itself. <br> We'll be going into the middle of December, which is a blessing, a lot of people don't get the opportunity to be on a major stage in front of that many people and be able to learn. I'm just taking it all in stride and being a student of the game because Kanye [West], he's a great performer. I'm not too shabby, like I said, again, but I'm just there really to challenge myself, grow myself and take that next level.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> During the brief interview, Lamar was also asked about what his next steps are. <br> Really getting back in that studio, locking in. Just keep continue with music, continue challenging myself. I don't really got much goin' on outside of music. So, that's about it."
Kendrick Lamar Says 'King of New York' Coronation Was Over Your Head,"August 29 2013, 10:24 PM ET <br> Kendrick Lamar might actually agree with SPIN's Brandon Soderberg that his flame-stoking ""Control"" verse is not as impressive as it seems. After declaring himself ""King of New York,"" the Prince of Compton retreated to a land of gonzo Robin Thicke videos, Miley-fied MTV VMA performances, and unlimited BET awards nominations, while his peers (and followers) lobbed response after response after response after response after, um, Hitler parody video. <br> But at long, last Lamar himself has issued a response, which more or less amounts to: ""Y'all trippin'."" In an interview with Peter Rosenberg of New York's Hot 97, the Black Hippy was asked what he thought about all of the excitement surrounding his Big Sean cameo. ""[It] was just a feature verse,"" he humble-bragged before revealing that it took him a few days to notice the hubub, since he'd been hanging out in the U.K. and all. He'd just wanted to ""rap some bars.""  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> The 20-minute chat can be heard below — hit play on the YouTube rip below to hear Lamar's thoughts on bicoastal rivalries, dangerous Twitter friends, and the business of elevating rap — but another gem emerged via a mere snippet of his forthcoming talk with Los Angeles radio's Power 106. Regarding his self-coronation, the West Coast MC let out a kingly scoff, lamented that he's been misunderstood, and let slip that he's been conferring with other rap royals. <br> ""I think that's a case of, yeah, maybe I have to dumb down my lyrics just a little bit,"" said Lamar. ""The irony of that line is the people that actually understood it and got it was the actual kings of New York — we've been sitting down with them this past week — and them understanding that it's not about actually being the king of whatever coast, it's about leaving a mark as great as Biggie, as great as Pac.” The entire Power 106 conversation airs Friday morning."
Kendrick Lamar vs Drake Rap Battle (Animated Battle),"[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] <br> Now, open your eyes up and listen up, Drizzy <br> What is so light, you're light-headed like you're getting dizzy  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> sh**, I'm bored; I'll finish the rest later"
Kendrick Lamar: It Was Written,"On the dull gray door to Studio 2 of the L.A. soundlab where Top Dawg Entertainment makes the magic happen, two warnings are posted <br> The first one, printed on TDE letterhead and titled “Studio Rules, b**h!!” reads like ScHoolboy Q wrote it, mostly because rule No. 3 is “Don't touch, ask, or reach for Q's weed.” The second sheet, also on TDE letterhead, is more serious. At the top, in black capital letters, it reads: “IF YOU NOT THE HOMIE, DON'T COME IN HERE.” At the bottom, in red letters: “DISREGARD THIS AND GET THE TIPS PUT ON YOU, HOMIE.” <br> The reason for the caution: On any given day, Kendrick Lamar might be in deep concentration working on the follow-up to his 2012 major label debut, good kid, m.A.A.d city. GKMC was more than a great album; it was a landmark event, a modern masterpiece to rival Illmatic, Reasonable Doubt, and Doggystyle. It's an artistically ambitious, highly personal piece of work: a day in the young artist's life, encompa**ing gang culture in his Compton hometown, alcohol, d**, life, d**h, God, family, and the pursuit of a girl named Sherane, a “concept album” that managed to sell over 1.2 million copies while making zero creative concessions. It transformed Kendrick from an Internet sensation into an A-list rap star <br> The success of GKMC in 2012, along with Ab-Soul's Control System and ScHoolboy Q's Habits & Contradictions, made TDE—launched in 1997 out of Anthony “Top Dawg” Tiffith's home studio in Carson, Calif.—the hottest new rap label around. With TDE, Odd Future, YG, DJ Mustard, Nipsey Hussle, and others all popping, L.A. has been reestablished as a vibrant rap city. The renaissance shows no signs of slowing this year, with acclaimed releases like YG's My Krazy Life, ScHoolboy Q's Oxymoron, and Ab-Soul's These Days.... Still, GKMC remains the crowning achievement <br> “When I went back to my old high school, all these kids looking at me like I'm the real big homie, the same way I look at Jay Z, Nas, or Dr. Dre,” says Kendrick with a laugh, sitting in his luxury trailer at his Complex cover shoot. “You would've thought Michael Jackson walked through that joint off the excitement that they had.” But now that Kendrick, 27, is a hysteria-inducing star, the world is waiting to see if he can deliver twice. Expectations are high. After good kid, good simply won't be good enough. Unlike GKMC, which Kendrick planned years in advance, there's no cover art in mind for the follow-up. As for a title, Kendrick says he's “flirting with ideas.” He's been working primarily with TDE's in-house producers, Tae Beast and Sounwave of Digi+Phonics, but has also gotten in the studio with Dr. Dre. He's still just “getting his ideas down,” but so far Kendrick's recorded 30 to 40 new songs for the album (he recorded 60 to 70 songs for GKMC). He says he'll be ready for a fourth quarter release <br> “Good kid set the bar,” says Terrence “Punch” Henderson, president of TDE and the crew's resident rap history buff. “Today, that's the album that you gotta compare your album to. Illmatic would be the comparison—it didn't sell the most records, but that was the standard.” <br> It's the cornerstone of Nas' legacy, but Illmatic was both a gift and a curse. Critics and fans alike compare all of Nas' subsequent albums to his 1994 debut and are never quite satisfied. Ditto for Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent, DMX, Slick Rick, and other rap greats who burst out of the gate with cla**ic albums. Although other legends—including Ice Cube, LL Cool J, and Kendrick's Interscope labelmate Eminem—delivered strong second albums that arguably surpa**ed their first efforts, creating a worthy follow-up is one of rap's greatest challenges <br> “Kendrick shook up the rap game, so anticipation for his second offering is through the roof,” says Nas. “Kendrick's an album guy and the album artist has a whole different kind of value. Kendrick is going to be one of the most important writers of our time; dude's a rhyming animal. Whatever he does will be appreciated, but at the same time he knows he has to bring it.” <br> Kendrick says there's less pressure on him now than there was right before good kid came out, when he was admittedly “super nervous.” “I was on the tour bus going back and forth on the text with Pharrell,” says Kendrick. “I asked him, ‘You think they gon' get it?' And he told me, ‘Don't ever doubt yourself again. Always be aware but don't ever mistake your first mind, your input of where your heart is at.'” <br> Today Kendrick trusts that his creative process will lead him where he needs to go. “If I keep focusing on, ‘I need to make something better than good kid,' it's going to be just that,” says Kendrick. “That's not challenging yourself. I don't want to become that person reflecting on what has been done. What I'm doing now is the question. I'm only as good as my last word, my last hook, my last bridge.” To fully appreciate the impact of GKMC, consider the context it was released in. Of the 10 biggest rap hits of 2012, two were by Flo Rida, two featured Nicki Minaj rapping over EDM-style production (including “Starships”), and one was “Gangnam Style.” For better or worse, Kendrick's Interscope labelmate Chief Keef had become a scapegoat for a perceived decline in rap lyrics and the fetishizing of ghetto violence by the media. Weeks before GKMC dropped, rap news was dominated by fights between G-Unit and MMG's camps at the BET Awards <br> Once GKMC sold 242,122 copies its first week, became the best reviewed rap album on Metacritic since Kanye West's My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, and discussions about the cla**ic status of the album hit a fevered pitch, Kendrick morphed from a promising rapper to the face of “real hip-hop.” Not just because of his artistic achievement, but because his celebrity relied solely on his musical output—not beef, fashion choices, business ventures, or the other gimmicks that have seemingly become part of the standard package for nearly every rapper <br> After the album's release, Kendrick's life was a whirlwind of tour dates and unexpected controversies. He toured non-stop in 2013, playing college campuses, festivals, opening for Kanye West on the Yeezus tour, and going on the good kid, m.A.A.d city world tour. During his tour, as he traveled from Sweden to Belgium with little Internet connection, Kendrick Lamar unintentionally set the rap world on fire On the night of August 12, 2013, Big Sean released the Kendrick Lamar and Jay Electronica–a**isted “Control”—a song meant for Sean's album, Hall of Fame, but left off due to sample clearance issues. On Lamar's earth-shattering verse he called himself the King of New York, a claim he shies away from now: “I feel B.I.G. and Jay will always be the King of New York.” More important, Lamar called out nearly every rapper in his generation—from A$AP Rocky to J. Cole and even Big Sean and Jay Electronica—and claimed, “I got love for you all but I'm tryna murder you n***as.” <br> By the next day, “Control” had taken on a life of its own. Instagram was overrun with “Control” memes, storm clouds of rap debates gathered, and thinkpieces poured out—even legendary NBA coach Phil Jackson, who was mentioned in the verse, got in the mix, tweeting at Kendrick. Just about every rapper, whether they were mentioned in the song or not, commented on the verse or dropped a response track. TMZ ran up on any rapper they could find, trying to goad them into responding. The week of the song's release, Kendrick picked up 208,000 new Twitter followers <br> Rappers are supposed to want to best each other—“I'm better than him” sums up rap's competitive mantra. But “Control” proved something contemporary philosopher Slavoj Žižek once argued about Wikileaks, what he calls “the paradox of public space”: “Even if everyone knows an unpleasant fact, saying it in public changes everything.” By naming names, Kendrick's verse was the moment he a**erted his dominance in rap. Earlier that year MTV had named Lamar the Hottest MC and Complex declared him the Best Rapper Alive; “Control” was when Lamar's status as the best coalesced I'm only as good as my last word, my last hook, my last bridge. One rapper Kendrick didn't mention in his “Control” verse was Macklemore. At the 56th Annual Grammy Awards, Macklemore's The Heist beat Kendrick's GKMC for Best Rap Album. Although Kendrick was nominated for seven awards, he went home empty handed, while Macklemore won Best New Artist, Best Rap Album, Best Rap Song, and Best Rap Performance. For fans on Twitter and members of the media (including Complex), Macklemore's wins and Kendrick's snubs served as a watershed moment for cultural appropriation in rap. To make matters worse, Macklemore Instagramed an apologetic text he sent to Kendrick after the awards that read, “I robbed you.” <br> “It wasn't really a huge deal for me,” says Kendrick, who's known Macklemore for over a year. “Macklemore deserves the accolades. That's still my partner regardless. He probably didn't need to Instagram the text. But what's done is done.”  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> Like Macklemore's success, Kendrick's comes after years on the independent grind. In 2003, when he was 16, Kendrick dropped his first mixtape under the moniker K-Dot. He released three more mixtapes before reverting to his government name (omitting his last name, Duckworth) and dropping the Kendrick Lamar EP in 2009. Over the next two years, with his mixtape Overly Dedicated and his independently released first album, Section.80, he found the voice that made GKMC a cla**ic. But Kendrick's acuity with words predates his musical output “My first-grade teacher flipped out because I wrote the word ‘audacity' in a story,” he recalls. “I knew the word only because I heard my auntie and uncles arguing, saying, ‘You got the audacity to take my motherf**ing drink and pour it out?!' I learned all my words like that, so when I went to school it was in my head.” <br> Kendrick's perspective on life always comes back to his Compton roots. His upbringing provides him with a treasure trove of traumatic experiences that give his music a sense of purpose. On the lyrical blackout “m.A.A.d city,” he describes seeing a “light-skin n***a with his brains blown out.” Around age 5, he witnessed his uncle's murder. In conversation, he casually recalls yet another murder, when he called his friend Yo to the barbershop just before someone shot up the block, k**ing one of their homeboys <br> GKMC apparently only scratched the surface of the stories Kendrick has to tell. “There were so many things I thought he was gonna talk about in good kid that he didn't,” says Kendrick's manager Dave Free, who remembers the days when K-Dot couldn't be spotted with a backpack, lest he be labeled a conscious rapper. “All these other stories, sh** that will blow your brain, have never been heard before because they're just too personal. There's still so much to be said. The question is, is he gonna say it?” <br> Whether or not Kendrick tells those stories could go a long way toward determining if he'll be able to top his major label debut. “I got a greater purpose,” he says. “God put something in my heart to get across and that's what I'm going to focus on, using my voice as an instrument and doing what needs to be done.” The only place to do that is back in the studio For a few hours, Kendrick can forget about his next album. He's back in Studio 2 working on a guest verse for Jay Rock's upcoming album. According to Dave, a typical Kendrick guest verse costs $250,000. They once charged $400,000. He's had some of his best moments on other people's songs: trading bars with Eminem on “Love Game,” introducing an R&B flow on Robin Thicke's “Give It 2 U,” stealing the show on A$AP Rocky's star-studded “f**in' Problems”—a song originally made for GKMC but given away because it didn't fit the narrative arc of the album <br> Kendrick gets to the studio at 3 p.m. and sits on a black couch in the lounge area playing Jay Rock tracks on his MacBook. He sports a navy blue Detroit Tigers hat, white T, gray sweats, and, for the third day in a row, a pair of blue Nike Roshe Runs with white polka dots. A gold and black painting of Snoop Dogg, with the lyrics to “Murder Was the Case” inscribed in cursive, hangs behind him. He turns the TV to an episode of South Park but keeps the volume down and doesn't even glance at the screen. Eyes fixed upon his computer, he listens to the music with his elbows on his thighs and his fingers interlocked. He rarely blinks After about 15 minutes in the lounge, he moves into the studio and connects his laptop to the speakers, playing Jay Rock's verse over and over, flipping around tracks, and sipping from a bottle of water. Later he'll chomp on an order of volcano salmon sushi. He tends to eat healthy—salads, baked chicken, lots of water. He plays basketball twice a week because, as Jay Z once said, rapping is “like an exercise.” And unlike many rappers—including his TDE labelmates ScHoolboy Q and Ab-Soul—he rarely drinks and doesn't smoke or sip lean. All the homies know not to bother him when he's busy in the lab. Sometimes he kicks everyone out of the studio so he can play instrumentals all night long, alone. He's been known to cut off his phone for months at a time God put something in my heart to get across and that's what I'm going to focus on Punch describes Kendrick as a “mad scientist” in the studio, but watching him at work, nothing seems erratic. If anything, he's supremely calculating; the song slowly builds as his process unfolds. Kendrick stands around mumble-rapping to himself with his right index finger extended, like he's pointing out each syllable as if it pa**es by on an imaginary teleprompter. He scribbles his verse on a small notepad that sits above a mic compressor. After about an hour, his verse is written. He takes a break, checks his email, and chats in the studio a bit before grabbing a studio engineer and getting to work. The engineer dims the lights and starts looping up the beat. Kendrick hums the verse to himself a few more times before he's ready to rock. Then he heads around the corner to the booth In the booth, Kendrick is a case study in precision. He raps with his eyes closed and his hands out as if he's casting a spell, rapping about “restricted territories” and “Percocet headaches.” On the first few takes, his voice sounds closer to his normal speaking voice than his agitated extraterrestrial rapping voice. He's rhyming slower than usual, taking his time to enunciate each line. After about five takes, he steps out of the booth and returns to the pad and paper he left on the compressor. He edits the verse on paper, scratching out some lines and writing new ones. But when he goes back to the booth, he leaves the paper behind “In the past, he never wrote down anything,” explains Sounwave, who produced “b**h, Don't k** My Vibe.” “Every now and then he'll write down stuff, just for insurance purposes. He rehearses the song over and over in his head so he can get the full feeling.” <br> Kendrick returns to the booth and slams the door shut. He does a couple more takes but keeps flubbing one line halfway through the verse. He steps back and paces around the booth, repeating the lines over and over as he internalizes the verse's structure. Then he looks up and says, “All right, let's get it.” That's when Derek “MixedByAli” Ali, Kendrick's regular engineer, walks in and takes over <br> “Watching Kendrick is like watching a master chess player playing five games at one time,” says Ali. “He can do five songs in one day. He'll start one song, then he'll be like, ‘I'ma start on this.' ‘I'ma go back to the old song.' ‘I'ma start on this.' There's just so much going on in his head.” When I'm in the studio I'm looking for a feeling I haven't felt. It's a high. Back in the booth, Kendrick is close to his 10th take. He hasn't perfected it yet—some takes have better cadence, others have better breath control. He repeats the process over and over to pinpoint exactly what he wants. “Keep that one,” he tells Ali, “I'ma do one more.” After about a dozen takes, his voice opens up and his words start to crackle. He blurts the word “b**h” into the mic with the spontaneity and violence of a sneeze <br> “It's not like, ‘Watch me get it in one take,'” says Sounwave. “It's like, ‘Watch me get the best take.' Sometimes we have a song complete and he's like, ‘Nah, my tone on that.... Redo the whole thing.' He redoes it and it's like a different song now just because of the tone that he switched up.” <br> After 30 minutes and 15 takes, Kendrick proclaims that the mic is “hot,” ready to catch his voice perfectly. Having used a light mix for reference initially while he figured out his vision, he asks Ali to give him a live mix, which sounds closer to the completed version, in his headphones Kendrick's idea of what this verse should be is coming to fruition. Each take is sharper. He's getting more animated in the booth, his head jerking as he screeches past each word. After about the 20th take, he's satisfied enough to hop out of the booth to review. He keeps editing the paper but casually remarks that he's done. It's 5 p.m. and he's on to the next <br> Like the human distractions Kendrick keeps out with a sign on the studio door, he doesn't let fear enter his creative space. “This is truly a blessing from a higher power,” Kendrick says, “and as long as I understand that there's really no limitations to what I can do. Everything is forward with me. When I'm in the studio I'm looking for creativity I haven't matched yet, a feeling I haven't felt. It's a high. When you look at people like Jay Z, Nas, Dr. Dre, these people are established, but they love music and they love that high. You always want that feeling of creativity.” And with that, Kendrick Lamar politely excuses himself. He's got work to do"
Kendrick Lamar: Rapper of the Year - GQ,"Reminder that you can click the images for more annotations. <br> Every member of rap's Mount Rushmore dropped new albums in 2013-Kanye, Jay Z, Drake, Eminem-but it was another MC altogether who stole the crown, and he did it with just a handful of verses: Kendrick Lamar, the latest-and possibly greatest-rapper to come straight outta Compton. <br> We are 10,000 feet above Compton in a private jet, and Kendrick Lamar is explaining to me what happened to him yesterday, when he vanished. We had a plan: Kendrick was going to give me a guided, cue-the-G-funk-synth Star Maps tour of his neighborhood, the one he still more or less lives in, starting at his parents' house a couple of blocks from his old high school, Centennial High, near the corner of Piru and South Central. Instead, he went AWOL. The whole day, no one from his label, Interscope, or Top Dawg Entertainment, the baby d**h Row Records that originally signed him, could track him down. Kendrick was gone. <br> It turned out he was sitting shivah for a murdered friend he calls his ""little bro""-a kid from a neighborhood where friendship is defined primarily by neighborhood. A few weeks earlier, Chad Keaton, 23, had been wounded in a drive-by shooting very close to Kendrick's parents' house. He held on for a month but ultimately died of complications from the gunshot wounds. <br> So today, here on board this Challenger 300 seven-seater, en route to New York City's fall Fashion Week, a destination filled with people Kendrick isn't sure whether he wants to impress or f** with, he's telling me about Chad. ""It all happened when I was overseas,"" he says. ""I had to talk to him over Skype on the hospital bed before he pa**ed."" <br> It's been a strange year. When it began, Kendrick was already regarded as something of a messiah among rap nerds-one of the best rappers ever to come out of the place that has produced many of the best rappers ever-and since then his legend has spread fast. <br> It actually began late last year, when Kendrick's major-label-debut album, good kid, m.A.A.d city,dropped, to universal acclaim. The album-about a day in the life of nerdy Compton teenager K.Dot and his homeys as they run around in his mom's minivan chasing ""that crazy-a** girl Sherane""-is practically a black Ulysses: a portrait of the rapper as a young man, simultaneously a drive-by deconstruction of gangster rap's violent tropes and a celebration of its signature, slow-rolling sound. On good kid, Lamar is our embedded correspondent, spitting triple-time confessionals from a part of the country most of us had forgotten once the rap scene found a fresher inner city to fetishize. He's the game's most linguistically cerebral MC, but also its realest-the one who finds the most vivid way to tell a story about his unemployed buddies trying to rope him into robbing some dude's house-and it's this polarity that makes listening to King Kendrick feel like you're putting on the illest 3-D gla**es in hip-hop. The music nods at influences far beyond the West Coast-Beach House samples, Dungeon Family lushness-but throughout, his voice stays singularly focused on a twenty-block radius around Central Avenue and Piru Street: <br> If Pirus and Crips all got along They'd probably gun me down by the end of this songGood kid, m.A.A.d city sold an industry-shocking 241,000 copies its first week and went platinum this summer. Then, in August, Kendrick snuck a sixty-four-bar Trojan horse into his buddy Big Sean's song ""Control""-a guest spot on a song that didn't even make the final record. After Big Sean goes on for a while about drinking champagne in Detroit, Kendrick wakes up the entire hip-hop universe, calling out nearly every single young rapper in the game: Drake; A$AP Rocky; J. Cole; Tyler, the Creator; even Big Sean himself. The dude slaps Sean on his own song. He also proclaimed himself ""the king of New York,"" which to certain East Coast ears sounded like a Greek dude strolling into Troy and dropping a deuce on the tomb of Hector. <br> ""Control"" leaked on YouTube late in the day on August 12; for a solid week, it was the biggest story in music. Just a few weeks after that, Kanye announced he was touring solo for the first time in five years and that his opening act would be Kendrick Lamar. <br> Kendrick's career momentum has created a dissonance that must look surreal from 30,000 feet. Chad Keaton's memorial service was held just before Labor Day weekend; Kendrick attended, then flew straight to a show in Alaska. Next it was on to Vegas to perform at a pool party. He only made it ""back to the set"" to grieve for a single day, the day we were scheduled to talk. ""It can be complicated and confusing,"" Kendrick says of his life right now, funerals for murdered friends one day, private jets to fashion parties the next. ""From my perspective, it's not just I'm famous-I still live in this world."" And when someone back home needs something, ""I still gotta get that phone call."" <br> It's clear the emotions are still raw. Kendrick is a small guy, just five feet six, and with his black hood pulled up over his head, a chain around the outside of his sweatshirt, it felt like I was talking to a wizened rap Jedi. After about an hour of questions, I gave him a break, and he lay down on the couch to rest. Just kind of curled up with his back turned. <br> A bit later, I saw a tweet from him to his 2.4 million followers pop up on my phone: ""When the cameras stop rolling, it doesn't mean real life will follow."" Instantly it had fifty-six retweets. After one minute, 600. After two minutes, 1,000. Then he tweeted a picture of Chad: ""Rest N Heaven my Lil bro. Watched u become a man. U fought bro. The city stole yo life, but not your legacy."" <br> On the night of the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, just as the heat over ""Control"" was peaking, I tailed Kendrick through the backstage maze at Brooklyn's Barclays Center. At one point, he ran into Drake, and they wrapped each other up in a big hug. It was their first encounter since Kendrick called him out on ""Control,"" and of all the slaps in that verse, this one felt the most personal, because Drake had helped break Kendrick, handing the kid not just a verse but an entire song on his second album. After Drake's VMA performance of ""Hold On, We're Going Home,"" Kendrick made his way back to the greenroom, crooning the hook: I got my eyes on you.... He caught mine and smiled. ""You watch,"" he joked, ""I'm going to be singing by my fifth album!"" <br> I asked if this meant things were cool between him and Drake. He paused. ""Pretty cool."" Shrugs. ""And I mean, I would be okay if we weren't.""  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> A month later, it became apparent that things between Kendrick and Drake were definitely not cool. After Drake's new album dropped, he gave a pair of interviews in which he sounded wounded by the ""Control"" thing: ""You can't just say that and then see me and be like, 'Yeah, man, what's up?'-pretending like nothing ever happened."" Seemingly in response, during the BET Hip-Hop Awards cypher a few weeks later, Kendrick freestyled: Nothing been the same since they dropped ""Control"" / and tucked a sensitive rapper back in his pajama clothes. <br> I got Kendrick on the phone after the BET taping, and he admitted to being surprised by Drizzy's public lash-out-""Control"" named names, sure, but at its core it was a backhanded tribute to the peers Kendrick actually gives a sh** about. Most of them took it in that spirit. Not Drake. ""Yeah, I guess he took it as a dis,"" Kendrick said, downplaying talk of a beef. But he was also clear that he doesn't look up to Drake, doesn't see him as any kind of creative influence. When I asked if Drake was a mentor or a role model, he replied quickly, ""No-peer. If anything. We all peers."" <br> When Kendrick Lamar was 21, 2Pac appeared to him in a vision. Before you roll your eyes, Lamar wants you to know that he's not the hermit-on-the-edge-of-the-Nitrian-Desert, vision-seeing type. He knows how this sounds. <br> ""I was coming from a late studio session, sleeping on Mom's couch. I'm 26 now-it wasn't that long ago. I remember being tired, tripping from the studio, lying down, and falling into a deep sleep and seeing a vision of Pac talking to me. Weirdest sh** ever. I'm not huge on superstition and all that sh**. That's what made it so crazy. It can make you go nuts. Hearing somebody that you looked up to for years saying, 'Don't let the music die.' Hearing it clear as day. Clear as day. Like he's right there. Just a silhouette."" <br> The visit from Pac changed Kendrick's connection to the world he was chronicling in his music and compelled him to think more carefully about who was listening to it. ""It wasn't just about money, hoes, clothes, drinkin',"" he explains. ""I mean, I come from that world, but at the same time, I started to realize that there's people out there that can't really connect to that lifestyle. They're in the struggle."" <br> Much of Kendrick's music now is an attempt to transcend his ravaged world without separating himself from it in judgment, about somehow gaining control over his household's chaos-some of his uncles were Crips, and his father was reportedly a Gangster Disciple in Chicago before moving to Compton-and over his neighborhood's warped commitment to adolescent pride. It's an ethos that extends to his crew. They have a seriousness of purpose, a rigorous discipline that can feel slightly monastic at times. Kendrick doesn't smoke weed or drink booze. In the time I spent with him, I never witnessed anyone roll even the thinnest spider leg of a jay, nor did I see Kendrick so much as glance at the many, many girls around him. ""When I ask OGs why there's so much division in the streets-nobody never really knows,"" he says. ""But you know one thing that everybody always mention? A woman."" <br> A few hours after the VMAs, we were back in Kendrick's hotel room and everybody was in a lull, staring at cell phones, waiting for news about afterparties. A plan coalesced to hit a party being thrown by Diddy at the Dream Downtown hotel. But one of Kendrick's Top Dawg boys leaned back and said, ""Aw, man, I can't go to no club."" <br> Kendrick spoke up. <br> ""We have to go."" <br> ""Look at you! We have to go. You're never we have to go."" <br> ""You know me,"" Kendrick explained. ""I only go when there's a point. Usually the point is just n***as drinking. But walking through the club the week after I released the 'Control' verse? That's a point!"" <br> Twenty minutes later, Anthony ""Top Dawg"" Tiffith, basically TDE's Suge Knight, asked if I had had a fun day. I said that I had and that I was surprised by their discipline. ""You guys seem so calm,"" I said. <br> ""Well,"" Tiffith told me, ""we're going to have to call it a night with you, because we about to get uncalm. You understand."" <br> The gossip from Diddy's Ciroc Amaretto Launch Party/VMA Afterparty sounded like it fell out of a ma**ive tear in the mid-'90s West Coast-East Coast time wave. Bloggers breathlessly recounted a surreal scene at Dream: booths packed with hip-hop illuminati-Jay, Bey-mouths agape as a wasted Diddy, incensed by the ""King of New York"" boast, attempted to pour a drink (Ciroc Amaretto, presumably) over Kendrick's head, only to be thwarted by Jay Z acolyte J. Cole, who was kicked out in the ensuing chaos. Naturally Kendrick himself refused to corroborate any of this. ""It was all love at that party,"" he told me on the private jet. <br> After we land at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, I catch a ride with Kendrick into Manhattan. His show tonight is a New York Fashion Week kickoff party in Chelsea thrown by industry doyenne Jenné Lombardo, and in the car he goofs around, imagining the horror he and his Compton homeys could inspire: ""We invited Kendrick Lamar, not K.Dot and them Piru n***as."" <br> By the end of his forty-minute set, the crowd is pretty f**ed-up. There's chronic in the air; models are tottering in their heels. When Kendrick launches into the call-and-response for ""Swimming Pools (Drank),"" a song about his family's dark relationship with chemical dependency-Head shot. DRANK. Sit down. DRANK. Stand up. DRANK-a wraithlike six-foot blonde with a white veil dances around a little coven of models. There is something demonic about the scene: Kendrick recounting his fever dreams about the grim consequences of decadence while presiding over a decadent Fashion Week party. <br> It's hard to guess how scenes like this will change Kendrick and his music. Sometime in January, he will step into Top Dawg's booth again, and he expects to be just as surprised as the rest of us by what comes out. ""I don't know,"" he says. ""It depends on where my emotion is. How angry I'll be, or how happy I'll be, or how confused I'll be."" <br> At one point on good kid Kendrick raps, ""I can feel the changes / I can feel a new life / I always knew life can be dangerous"". The biggest change in Kendrick's life is the inversion of rap's consummate observer becoming the observed. How will all eyez on him affect his art? Because he's already 10,000 feet above Compton, and rising."

Last Real n***a Alive,"[Hook] <br> Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ <br> He's just nice, he just slice like a ginnsu <br> Look at the life that I been through <br> We the last real n***as alive, that's official <br> [Kendrick Lamar] <br> Let me tell you when it all started <br> Game dropped Documentary and made plenty enemies <br> It was a cla**ic album, but prior to that <br> Guerilla Black debuted and put the city on wax <br> A lot of Biggie comparisons, we all was aware of them <br> But that wasn't my M.O., I just thought he was dope <br> Can't understand why Game would say his name in that manner <br> Many years went by, still no legitimate answer <br> Anyway, I put out a mixtape in 12th grade <br> Hub City threat, minor of the year, DJ Dave <br> And his brother designed, put together the music <br> Put it out to the people, the people said I was stupid <br> With the flow, went to the barbershop to show off my sk**s <br> Mike and Himey and some other cat said I was real <br> Himey was Games barber, the other cat made a statement <br> Saying that Game was his partner, so I gave him my tape <br> Said he'd play it for him, hoping that I'd get my big break <br> But never got a response.. anyway <br> This n***a named ?Pop Givs? came to my school with a camera <br> I freestyled on his DVD for a minute then after <br> It hit the streets, I was known as K. Dot from Compton <br> Man Hootie probably was the youngest out that was poppin' <br> But I didn't have a home yet, Hootie had ? in me <br> Until I met Top Dawg, told Dave that he'd like to meet <br> Me at the studio, made me freestyle for an hour <br> Told me come back tomorrow, but I came back in a hour <br> Jay Rock was in the booth, recording his first mixtape <br> Was skeptical homie at first because he knew where I stayed <br> But we got over that, heard the beat, wrote a rap <br> Did our first collaboration on the Nephew track <br> He got signed months later, Warner Brothers <br> We started on his album, he wrote his rhymes on paper <br> Before Sidekicks became a modern day phone <br> Same time our buzz was generated from G Malone <br> He had a song called 200, White Lightnin, the streets loved it <br> Said that Sony had gave him an unbelievable budget <br> Now that's a smart n***a, I'm tryna make my raps bigger than life <br> But not knowing how to market it right <br> Turned on the radio <br> Only cat he knew from the West Coast was playin' was Bishop <br> And by then this n***a' buzz was tremendous <br> In the lab, me and Rock tryna perfect our craft <br> What the f**? Next thing you know, we came across Lift Me Up <br> It was a hit <br> When I heard it <br> But all we had was the instrumental and the hook <br> But when <br> Rock jump on it for certain, it was to smash <br> Gave it to Julio, just to get his opinion <br> Next thing you know, the record was <br> Spinning <br> That was a good look, it set the coast on fire  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> n***as in Garden projects presents Watts Riot <br> Then these rappers start hating, callin' up to the station <br> Ask why they record ain't playin', what you n***as complaining, about? <br> sh** was funny to us tho <br> n***as hate to see a n***a from the bottom come up, yo <br> In the midst of the single poppin' and n***as tryna seek and destroy <br> I had a situation with Def Jam, premature <br> sh** went sour after Jay-Z left but they didn't care <br> I was glad Jay-Z gave me respect <br> See I was young, fast forward, hot dollah had the streets on lock <br> Far as radio play, obvious, he got a lot <br> Beefing' with Daz Dilinger, Jay Rock spoke on it <br> Which in my opinion, I didn't think the sh** was impo'tant <br> But that's a whole 'nother story, we hit the lab with Game <br> And a few other names like Juice and Young, ya boy <br> Did the cypher freestyle and everybody's like, ""Wow"" <br> These Top Dawg n***as 'bout to make noise"" <br> Surely after Game took us on tour, I love you for that <br> But right after that, we didn't see him no more <br> G Malone came with a smash hit with Akon <br> Mistah FAB battled Royce Nickel with napalm <br> Then everybody start to scream out the new West <br> And claim that West Coast legends don't want to see him at best <br> I think that's just an excuse, because their music ain't tight <br> Tell 'em that Ab-soul said it, they can quote him twice <br> Then Crooked I came with Hip-Hop Weekly, k**in' the internet <br> But he been a threat since d**hrow, then Rocky came about <br> And all I thought about was Ab-Soul 2-11-2 <br> It finally started to look like the West was makin' moves <br> Western Union had the whole block boomin' because of Snoop <br> Matter fact, Bad Luck was my favorite about the group <br> Then ?Problem? took off, another Compton native <br> We both Compton n***as, but Compton still ain't made it <br> By this time, Jay Rock and All My Life hit the airwaves <br> We almost got into some major beef over Lil' Wayne <br> That part I'mma leave out <br> Theres certain things that the streets only should know about <br> Shout out to Nipsey <br> Bishop win that game, then had a fight with ? <br> That's when I dropped C4 and had the critics mad at me <br> Because they didn't see my views, grab the hottest album out and re-do it <br> That's a goddamn power move stupid <br> You foolish, don't know sh** about this war sh** <br> Theres mo' sh** to wanting to be the king of the coast sh** <br> [Hook x2] <br> [Outro: Kendrick Lamar] <br> So two weeks ago I finally run into the n***a I gave my mixtape too <br> And said he was partners with Game <br> The n***a finally told me what he said <br> He said he didn't like it <br> But the n***as like <br> ""See, see, look at you, look at you now, I tried to tell him you was tight"" <br> n***a probably never even gave it to him and sh**"

Like how much are you dependent? <br> How clutch are the people that say they love you and who pretending? <br> How tough is your skin when they turn you in, do you show forgiveness? <br> What brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended <br> What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing <br> What kind of bridge did they burn, revenge or your mind when it's mentioned? <br> You wanna love like Nelson, you wanna be like Nelson <br> You wanna walk in in his shoes but you peace-making seldom <br> You wanna be remembered that delivered the message <br> That considered the blessing of everyone, this your lesson for everyone, say <br> [Bridge 3] <br> [Hook 2] <br> [Verse 3] <br> I been wrote off before, I got abandonment issues <br> I hold grudges like bad judges, don't let me resent you <br> That's not Nelson-like, want you to love me like Nelson <br> I went to Robben's Island an*lysing, that's where his cell is <br> So I could find clarity, like how much you cherish me <br> Is this relationship a fake or real as the heavens be? <br> See I got to question it all, family, friends, fans, cats, dogs <br> Trees, plants, gra**, how the wind blow <br> Murphy's Law, generation X, will I ever be your ex? <br> Floss off a baby step, mobbed by the mouth a bit <br> Pause, put me under stress <br> Crawled under rocks, ducking y'all, it's respect <br> But then tomorrow, put my back against the wall <br> How many leaders you said you needed then left 'em for dead? <br> Is it Moses, is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red? <br> Is it Martin Luther, JFK, shooter you a**a**in <br> Is it Jackie, is it Jesse, oh I know, it's Michael Jackson, oh <br> [Bridge 4] <br> When sh** hit the fan, is you still a fan? <br> When sh** hit the fan, is you still a fan? <br> That n***a gave us Billie Jean, you say he touched those kids? <br> When sh** hit the fan, is you still a fan? <br> [Hook 3] <br> The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it <br> Let my word be your earth and moon you consume every message <br> As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression <br> And if you riding with me n***a, let me ask this question n***a <br> [Outro: Kendrick Lamar & 2Pac] <br> [Kendrick Lamar] <br> ""I remember you was conflicted <br> Misusing your influence <br> Sometimes I did the same <br> Abusing my power, full of resentment <br> Resentment that turned into a deep depression <br> Found myself screaming in the hotel room <br> I didn't wanna self destruct <br> The evils of Lucy was all around me <br> So I went running for answers <br> Until I came home <br> But that didn't stop survivor's guilt <br> Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned <br> Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was <br> But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city, I was entering a new one <br> A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination <br> Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned <br> The word was respect <br> Just because you wore a different gang colour than mines <br> Doesn't mean I can't respect you as a black man <br> Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets <br> If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from k**ing us <br> But I don't know, I'm no mortal man, maybe I'm just another n***a"" <br> sh** and that's all I wrote <br> I was gonna call another n***a but, it ain't really a poem, I just felt like it's something you probably could relate to. Other than that, now that I finally got a chance to holla at you, I always wanted to ask you about a certain situa--, about a metaphor actually, you spoke on the ground. What you mean 'bout that, what the ground represent?  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> [2Pac] <br> The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil. That's how I see it, my word is bond. I see and the ground is the symbol for the poor people, the poor people is gonna open up this whole world and swallow up the rich people. Cause the rich people gonna be so fat, they gonna be so appetising, you know what I'm saying, wealthy, appetising. The poor gonna be so poor and hungry, you know what I'm saying it's gonna be like... there might be some cannibalism out this mutha, they might eat the rich <br> [Kendrick Lamar] <br> Aight so let me ask you this then, do you see yourself as somebody that's rich or somebody that made the best of their own opportunities? <br> [2Pac] <br> I see myself as a natural born hustler, a true hustler in every sense of the word. I took nothin', I took the opportunities, I worked at the most menial and degrading job and built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it. I went from having somebody manage me to me hiring the person that works my management company. I changed everything I realised my destiny in a matter of five years you know what I'm saying I made myself a millionaire. I made millions for a lot of people now it's time to make millions for myself, you know what I'm saying. I made millions for the record companies, I made millions for these movie companies, now I make millions for us <br> [Kendrick Lamar] <br> And through your different avenues of success, how would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity? <br> [2Pac] <br> By my faith in God, by my faith in the game, and by my faith in all good things come to those that stay true. You know what I'm saying, and it was happening to me for a reason, you know what I'm saying, I was noticing, I was punching the right bu*tons and it was happening. So it's no problem, you know I mean it's a problem but I'm not finna let them know. I'm finna go straight through <br> [Kendrick Lamar] <br> Would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall? <br> [2Pac] <br> I like to think that at every opportunity I've ever been threatened with resistance it's been met with resistance. And not only me but it goes down my family tree. You know what I'm saying, it's in my veins to fight back <br> [Kendrick Lamar] <br> Aight well, how long you think it take before n***as be like, we fighting a war, I'm fighting a war I can't win and I wanna lay it all down <br> [2Pac] <br> In this country a black man only have like 5 years we can exhibit maximum strength, and that's right now while you a teenager, while you still strong or while you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back. Cause once you turn 30 it's like they take the heart and soul out of a man, out of a black man in this country. And you don't wanna fight no more. And if you don't believe me you can look around, you don't see no loud mouth 30-year old muthaf**as <br> [Kendrick Lamar] <br> That's crazy, because me being one of your offspring of the legacy you left behind I can truly tell you that there's nothing but turmoil goin' on so I wanted to ask you what you think is the future for me and my generation today? <br> [2Pac] <br> sh**, I think that n***as is tired-a grabbin' sh** out the stores and next time it's a riot there's gonna be bloodshed for real. I don't think America can know that. I think American think we was just playing and it's gonna be some more playing but it ain't gonna be no playing. It's gonna be murder, you know what I'm saying, it's gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831, up in this muthaf**a. You know what I'm saying, it's gonna happen <br> [Kendrick Lamar] <br> That's crazy man. In my opinion, only hope that we kinda have left this music and vibrations, lotta people don't understand how important it is. Sometimes I be like, get behind a mic and I don't know what type of energy I'mma push out, or where it comes from. Trip me out sometimes <br> [2Pac] <br> Because the spirits, we ain't really rappin', we just letting our dead homies tell stories for us <br> [Kendrick Lamar] <br> Damn <br> I wanted to read one last thing to you. It's actually something a good friend had wrote describing my world. It says: <br> ""The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it <br> Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it, in order to protect itself from this mad city <br> While consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive <br> One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him, but praises the bu*terfly <br> The bu*terfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness, and the beauty within the caterpillar <br> But having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the bu*terfly as weak and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits <br> Already surrounded by this mad city the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him <br> He can no longer see past his own thoughts <br> He's trapped <br> When trapped inside these walls certain ideas start to take roots, such as going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city <br> The result? <br> Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant <br> Finally free, the bu*terfly sheds light on situations that the caterpillar never considered, ending the eternal struggle <br> Although the bu*terfly and caterpillar are completely different, they are one and the same."" <br> What's your perspective on that? <br> Pac, Pac, Pac"

Kendrick pone una serie di domande a loro chiedendo se sono disposti a subire lo stesso dolore e a fidarsi di chi gi sta intorno e gli vuole bene abbastanza da sopportare una lunga prigionia x combattere affinche i diritti di tutti vengano rispettati, senza vendicarsi e anzi perdonando i propri nemici una volta fuori come ha fatto Madiba <br> 2) Durante il viaggio fatto in Sudafrica, Kendrick è andato a visitare Robben Island, nota x essere il luogo dove venivato tenuti i prigionieri politici nel periodo dell'apartheid. Mandela scontò 18 anni della sua detenzione li e x questo quando Kendrick si è trovato all'interno della sua cella ha messo in dubbio tutto quello in cui credeva prima, chiedendosi se chi dice di amarlo sarebbe disposto a rimanergli vicino anche se lui venisse arrestato lasciando che diventi la loro guida una volta fuori. senza mettere in dubbio la sua innocenza nonostante le accuse subite e da qui arriva il riferimento alla legge di Murphy secondo cui se qualcosa può andare male lo farà, perche se lascia**ero prevalere i dubbi sulla fiducia incondizionata da dargli, tutta la lotta da fare insieme sarebbe inutile visto che lo abbandonerebbero gradualmente e lo lascerebbero a lottare da solo, senza possibilità di vincere x loro <br> 3) Kendrick cita una serie di personaggi di spicco della storia, dello sport, della politica e dello spettacolo che sono stati fonte d'ispirazione x chi li seguiva, al punto da diventare motivo scatenante x ribellarsi all'oppressione subita. Kendrick fa però notare come tutti questi personaggi siano stati abbandonati o lasciati morire da soli, venendo traditi da chi li supportava una volta che le cose si sono fatte difficili e dalle parole si doveva pa**are ai fatti. In particolare Kendrick fa riferimento a Michael Jackson perche da idolo delle folle, pa**ò a nemico pubblico numero 1 dopo le accuse di molestie e abusi sessuali su minore ricevute dalla famiglia di Gavin Arvizo, un bambino che Jackson aveva aiutato a guarire dal cancro. Alla fine del processo Jacko fu dichiarato innocente su tutti i capi d'imputazione ma nonostante cio molte persone reputano quella come una macchia nella sua vita e gli hanno voltato le spalle giudicandolo male senza conoscere i fatti. Kendrick ha paura di fare la stessa fine semmai gli si presenta**e davanti una situazione simile, venendo abbandonato da chi lo segue nonostante tutto cio che di positivo ha dato al suo pubblico entrando nell'industria musicale con umiltà, x poi diventare un'icona lanciando messaggi di speranza tramite le sue canzoni che teme non vengano piu presi sul serio semmai dovesse affrontare situazioni in cui la loro fiducia in lui è messa in discussione"

Pay It Forward," <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> As a kid, having a mentor was vital to me. Always being there when it counted allowed me to make some of the most important decisions while growing up. So it's only right that I mentor a younger person with the same wisdom that was given to me. If it helps the next kid become a better person in life, I will forever be aware of my influence and pay it forward. I look where I'm at today and realize that most of my success is owed to the mentors that was in my life. <br> I sat down with President Barack Obama and shared the same views. Topics concerning the inner cities, the problem, the solutions and furthermore embracing the youth, both being aware that mentoring saves lives. Sometimes I reflect and think back, ""Where would I be if I didn't had the presence of an older acquaintance telling me what's right and what's wrong?"" Telling me the pros and cons of every move I was about to make. Telling me the best way to plan success for my future. Join me in paying it forward. Support My Brother's Keeper by being a mentor in real life."

Q&A Interview With Kendrick Lamar,"So you're performing in Brixton on Monday, what happens at one of your live shows? <br> Craziness. A lot of energy, a lot of energy from myself and the crowd <br> How do you feel in front of a crowd? <br> I feel at peace, you know. It's a way to express yourself, a way to vent, put all your emotions out on that stage <br> Where was your first ever gig? <br> My first ever was at a hole in the wall place, in a small city, in a small club in Los Angeles <br> What happened? <br> I was probably terrible.. But it was a growing experience, a growing process, and you know, you never forget those moments <br> Who was the first person to tell you that you were good at music? <br> The first person to tell me was probably this guy named Dave Free, he's my manager now, since I was like tenth grade...yeah <br> How did he discover you? <br> Through a mutual friend, it was all in high school, rapping and stuff. And then a mutual friend told him about me and we decided to start doing music and we've been doing it ever since <br> How did he help you to develop your sound? <br> He really just allowed me to experience different things in music, and listen to different people, he got a broad playlist in music everybody from west coast, to the east coast. And basically we just started developing there <br> You said in an interview before that your mum told you that whatever you do, you just gotta do it really, really well. What does she make of your success now? <br> Oh yeah, she loves it. She sees that I took heed in what she was saying because you have people that's calling me the best at what I do, and you know l pride myself in that. She always said that whatever you do make sure that you're the best at it <br> What kind of a son were you when you were younger? <br> I was a good son, respectful, I never disrespected my mother, I never disrespected my father intentionally. Probably some of the things I did, outside of the house were a little bit outlandish, but as far as verbal disrespect or inner presence disrespect, never, so, I was a good son <br> What are your earliest memories of their music? <br> A lot of oldies, gangster rap was played in my household, which really inspired my sound today from new melodic driven, aggressive type feel <br> What track or album have you listened to more than any other? <br> That's hard, that's tough. They played a lot of 2Pac All Eyez On Me, Me Against The World, they probably played that track a hundred thousand times in our house <br> How did the collaboration with Drake happen? <br> I went on his Club Paradise tour and we really built a bond, a relationship, since the first time we met. He put me on his album, which was the interlude, red light interlude, we always said it was gonna work, it was just about finding the right song, that was the right song <br> What happened in your first meeting with Dre? <br> I was very excited, I wasn't nervous at all. I was more excited, cause I knew that this was my shot, everything that l've worked for, everything I've built up to came down to that moment <br> What happened in that moment? <br> That moment I recorded my first song with Dre, which was Compton, which is the last song on my album <br> Do you speak to him on a daily basis? <br> Yeah I talk to him <br> And what's he up to at the moment? <br> At the moment he's just working his Beats by Dre. Doing a lot of promo and press for that, getting buried in life right now <br> Can you see yourself moving to projects outside of music like he does with Beats? <br> Yeah definitely. You know when you conquer one thing, you want to move on to the next and be able to challenge yourself? He inspired me to want to do that, once l get the years behind me, of being exceptionally great at music  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> Are you creative in other ways outside of the music? <br> Yeah. I'm very hands on with the whole visual and concepts beyond the music <br> Are you a competitive person? <br> Very competitive <br> So where does success lie? <br> Success lies in challenging myself, thats where l get my success <br> And how will you ever be fulfilled? <br> Probably when l see that my music has touched more people than l can possibly imagine, and that point in time will come <br> What do your lyrics say about you as a person? <br> My lyrics say that I have morals, say that I have confidence, say I have weaknesses, say I have strong points, say l am a human being <br> What are the morals that you live by? <br> Treat others the way you want to be treated. That's the number one, that's something that my mother always told me. That's the one piece of advice I would give everybody and the world would be a better place <br> Can you tell me about the picture on the front cover of the album? <br> The front cover really represents the lifestyle that I'm used to, the coming up, seeing a lot of parties, a lot of good times, a lot of bad times and really I blanked the eyes out so that you see the innocence, the little boy that's in there, which is me. No matter what he is around, you still see the vulnerability in this kid, you know that he wants to figure out whats going on around him <br> Do you think your music comes from a positive place? <br> Yes. My music comes from a positive place, only because I was once in a dark place before in my life so, to actually get to that positive space you have to come in this negative world, where you're striving to do something better for yourself <br> How did you allow those negative situations to not affect you, or jade you? <br> Just knowing something was bigger than me, something was bigger than just Compton, something was bigger than the trouble we were getting ourselves involved in, I knew something was more, and l wanted more for myself. Not only for myself but for the people l care about <br> Are you still based in Compton now? <br> No, I'm a rolling stone. I don't have a place to stay. Im roaming the world <br> What do you do with all your stuff? <br> My mother has all that stuff. I'm in the world now, I like to see other things. Cause for so long when you're in Compton, its all you think that exists, so when I finally got out to see other places, like London, it makes you want to continue the travel <br> When you're travelling what are things you have to have with you at all times? <br> Fresh pair of drawers, fresh pair of socks <br> How have you been enjoying London? <br> I love it. Y'all weather's a bit gloomy right now, I like gloomy weather, I work best and do most of my album under gloomy weather, so you'll hear a lot of dark tracks in there <br> How are British fans different to your US fans? <br> There's a little bit more excitement with British fans, a little bit more energy, I think you guys just appreciate a little bit more <br> Out of all the tracks you have written, which do you feel the most proud of now? <br> The most proud of is tough, I've written a lot of tracks. If it had to be from this album, any one off this album really, sing about me, l'm real, Compton <br> From the previous mixtapes, are there any songs that you've written that you find difficult to listen back to now? <br> What's crazy is that l don't listen to none of my older music, just because I always wanted the team to grow. I don't wanna get caught back in that time, or critiquing what i should have done or what sounds right <br> Who will you collaborate with in the future? <br> I'm really tight on collaborations, I always say Erykah Badu, that's it for now, that's always in the back of my mind"

This right here controls how everybody move and how everybody thinking. You live in a world full of hate. You feel me? The homies right here hating on you, they finna rob you. They finna do this, boom, he gon' come in there. Chameleon. And you think he with you and your crew, but he working on the act of love. Y'all powered up and dap out and move out to the next spot. You going to a spot full of discrimination. He blending in there too. You know? He might got a suit on. You feel me? But he acting on the work of love. And what that does is, his energy builds up to the next man and builds up all the way around the world and everybody is just full of this superb energy. Everybody getting money. Happy. Living and enjoying their lives. And not hating on the next man. That's what he do. He might pull up in a Pinto, you feel? Or a two-door Honda or something like that. You know? Or if he in a prestige spot he might pull up in a Beamer, whatever the case is. His whole thing is about reality of it, you know, and not putting the cape on. You know? Cause he something different than a superhero. The archenemy villain, that's easy. I don't know if I wanna say a woman or a man, but I name her Lucy. Matter of fact, we gon' put it to a stone, we gon' disguise Lucy as a woman. In actuality it's Lucifer, it's a man though. She's seductive, she seduces everybody. She comes into a room and walk out. You think you feeling the love, but once you walk out it's nothing but negative tension around. You feel me? (I wanna see this movie, man) Yeah, ""Hardbody."" Yeah, we gon' do that. (That's crazy)  <br>  <br>  <br> "

TDE CEO Responds To Portrayal In Kendrick's GQ Cover Story,"In 2004, I founded Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE) with the goal of providing a home for west coast artists and a platform for these artists to express themselves freely and to give their music to the world. From our beginning in 2005 with Jay Rock, to developing Kendrick Lamar, ScHoolboy Q, and Ab-Soul, to most recently singing Isaiah Rashad and SZA. We, as TDE, have always prided ourselves in doing everything with heart, honor, and respect. <br> The racial overtones, immediately reminded everyone of a time in hip-hop that was destroyed by violence, resulting in the loss of two of our biggest stars. <br> This week, Kendrick Lamar was named one of GQ's 2013 Men Of The Year, an honor that should have been celebrated as a milestone in his career and for the company. <br> Instead, the story, written by Steve Marsh, put myself and my company in a negative light. Marsh's story was more focused on what most people would see as drama or bs. To say he was ""surprised at our discipline"" is completely disrespectful. Instead of putting emphasis on the good that TDE has done for west coast music, and for hip hop as a whole, he spoke on what most people would consider whats wrong with Hip Hop music. Furthermore, Kendrick deserved to be accurately documented. The racial overtones, immediately reminded everyone of a time in hip-hop that was destroyed by violence, resulting in the loss of two of our biggest stars. We would expect more from a publication with the stature and reputation that GQ has. As a result of this misrepresentation, I pulled Kendrick from his performance at GQ's annual Man Of The Year party Tuesday, November 12th.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> While we think it's a tremendous honor to be named as one of the Men Of The Year, these lazy comparisons and offensive suggestions are something we won't tolerate.

The Trials of Kendrick Lamar,"A drizzly Sunday morning in Compton, the sky an un-California-ish gray. Into the parking lot of a local hamburger stand pulls a chromed-out black Mercedes SUV, driven by 27-year-old Kendrick Lamar, arguably the most talented rapper of his generation. there are a half-dozen guys from the neighborhood waiting to meet him: L, Turtle, G-Weed. ""I grew up with all these cats,"" Lamar says. He nods to Mingo, a Compton-born sweetheart who is roughly the size of the truck he arrived in: ""I don't need to hire a bodyguard. Look how f**ing big he is!"" The burger joint, Tam's, sits at the corner of Rosecrans and Central, a famous local spot recently made infamous when Suge Knight allegedly ran over two men with his truck in the parking lot, k**ing one of them. ""Homey died right here,"" G-Weed says, pointing to a dark spot on the asphalt. ""That security camera caught everything. They're building a case."" <br> Lamar grew up just six blocks from here, in a little blue three-bedroom house at 1612 137th St. Across the street is the Louisiana Fried Chicken where he used to get the three-piece meal with fries and lemonade; over there is the Rite Aid where he walked to buy milk for his little brothers. Tam's was another hangout. ""This is where I seen my second murder, actually."" he says. ""Eight years old, walking home from McNair Elementary. Dude was in the drive-thru ordering his food, and homey ran up, boom boom - smoked him."" He saw his first murder at age five, a teenage drug dealer gunned down outside Lamar's apartment building. ""After that,"" he says, ""you just get numb to it."" <br> It's almost noon, but Lamar is just starting his day - having spent a late night in the studio scrambling to finish his new album, To Pimp a bu*terfly, which has to be done in five days. He's dressed casually in a gray hoodie, maroon sweatpants, and white socks with black slides, but recognizable enough that an old lady in line decides to tease him while complaining about the heat inside. ""Y'all need to put the air conditioner on,"" she calls to the manager. ""Kendrick Lamar is here!"" <br> Lamar may be a two-time Grammy winner with a platinum debut executive-produced by Dr. Dre, and with fans from Kanye West to Taylor Swift. But here at Tam's, he's also Kendrick Duckworth, Paula and Kenny's son. Inside, a middle-aged woman who just left church comes up and gives him a hug, and he buys lunch for a cart-toting lady he knows used to be a harmless crack addict. (""She used to chase us with sticks and stuff, he says.) Outside, an old man in a motorized wheelchair scoots over to introduce himself. He says he moved here in 1951, when Compton was still majority-white. ""Back in the day, we had the baddest cars in L.A.,"" he says. ""I just wanted you to know where you came from. It's a hell of a neighborhood."" <br> On his breakthrough album, 2012's good kid, m.A.A.d City, Lamar made his name by chronicling this neighborhood, vividly evoking a specific place (this same stretch of Rosecrans) and a specific time (in the summer of 2004, between 10th and 11th grade). It was a concept album about adolescence, told with cinematic precision through the eyes of someone young enough to recall every detail (as in: ""Me and my n***as four deep in a white Toyota/A quarter tank of gas, one pistol, one orange soda"") <br> Lamar's parents moved here from Chicago in 1984, three years before Kendrick was born. His dad, Kenny Duckworth, was reportedly running with a South Side street gang called the Gangster Disciples, so his mom, Paula Oliver, issued an ultimatum. ""She said, 'I can't f** with you if you ain't trying to better yourself,'"" Lamar recounts. ""'We can't be in the streets forever.'"" They stuffed their clothes in two black garbage bags and boarded a train to California with $500. ""They were going to go to San Bernardino,"" Lamar says. ""But my Auntie Tina was in Compton. She got 'em a hotel until they got on their feet, and my mom got a job at McDonald's."" For the first couple of years, they slept in their car or motels, or in the park when it was hot enough. ""Eventually, they saved enough money to get their first apartment, and that's when they had me."" <br> Lamar has a lot of good memories of Compton as a kid: riding bikes, doing back flips off friends' roofs, sneaking into the living room during his parents' house parties. (""I'd catch him in the middle of the dance floor with his shirt off,"" his mom says. ""Like, 'What the...? Get back in that room!'"") Then there's one of his earliest memories - the afternoon of April 29th, 1992, the first day of the South Central riots <br> Kendrick was four. ""I remember riding with my pops down Bullis Road, and looking out the window and seeing motherf**ers just running,"" he says. ""I can see smoke. We stop, and my pops goes into the AutoZone and comes out rolling four tires. I know he didn't buy them. I'm like, 'What's going on?'"" (Says Kenny, ""We were all taking stuff. That's the way it was in the riots!"") <br> ""Then we get to the house,"" Lamar continues, ""and him and my uncles are like, 'We fixing to get this, we fixing to get that, we fixing to get all this sh**!' I'm thinking they're robbing. There's some real mayhem going on in L.A. Then, as time progresses, I'm watching the news, hearing about Rodney King and all this, I said to my mom, 'So the police beat up a black man, and now everybody's mad? Ok. I get it now.'"" <br> We've been sitting on the patio a while when Lamar sees someone he knows at the bus stop. ""Matt Jeezy! What up, bro?"" Matt Jeezy nods. ""That's my boy,"" Lamar says. ""He's part of the inner circle."" Lamar has a few friends like this, guys he's known all his life. But often he'd rather be by himself <br> ""He was always a loner,"" Kendrick's mom says. Lamar agrees: ""I was always in the corner of the room watching."" He has two little brothers and one younger sister, but until he was seven, he was an only child. He was so precocious his parents nicknamed him Man-Man. ""I grew up fast as f**,"" he says. ""My moms used to walk me home from school - we didn't have no car - and we'd talk from the county building to the welfare office."" ""He would ask me questions about Section 8 and the Housing Authority, so I'd explain it to him,"" his mom says. ""I was keeping it real."" <br> The Duckworths survived on welfare and food stamps, and Paula did hair for $20 a head. His dad had a job at KFC, but at a certain point, says Lamar, ""I realized his work schedule wasn't really adding up."" It wasn't until later that he suspected Kenny was probably making money off the streets. ""They wanted to keep me innocent,"" Lamar says now. ""I love them for that."" To this day, he and his dad have never discussed it. ""I don't know what type of demons he has,"" Lamar says, ""but I don't wanna bring them sh**s up."" (Says Kenny, ""I don't want to talk about that bad time. But I did what I had to do."") <br> There's a famous story from Tom Petty's childhood in which a 10-year-old Tom sees Elvis shooting a movie near his hometown in Florida, takes on look at the white Cadillac and the girls, and decides to become a rock star on the spot. Lamar has a similar story - only for him it's sitting on his dad's shoulders outside the Compton Swap Meet, age eight, watching Dr. Dre and 2Pac shoot a video for ""California Love."" ""I want to say they were in a white Bentley,"" Lamar says. (It was actually black.) ""These motorcycle cops trying to conduct traffic but one almost scraped the car, and Pac stood up on the pa**enger seat, like, 'Yo, what the f**!'"" He laughs. ""Yelling at the police, just like on his motherf**ing songs. He gave us what we wanted."" <br> Being a rapper was far from preordained for Lamar. As late as middle school, he had a noticeable stutter. ""Just certain words,"" he says. ""It came when I was excited or in trouble."" He loved basketball - he was short, but quick - and dreamed of making it to the NBA. But in seventh grade, an English teacher named Mr. Inge turned him on to poetry - rhymes, metaphors, double-entendres - and Lamar fell in love. ""You could put all your feelings down on a sheet of paper, and they'd make sense to you,"" he says. ""I liked that."" <br> At home, Lamar started writing non-stop. ""We used to wonder what he was doing with all that paper,"" his dad says. ""I thought he was doing homework! I didn't know he was writing lyrics."" ""I had never heard him say profanity before,"" says his mom. ""Then I found his little rap lyrics, and it was all 'Eff you.' 'D-i-c-k.' I'm like, 'Oh, my God! Kendrick's a cusser!'"" <br> An A student, Lamar flirted with the idea of going to college. ""I could have went. I should have went."" (He still might: ""It's always in the back of my mind. It's not too late."") But by the time he was in high school, he was running with a bad crowd. This is the crew he raps about on good kid, m.A.A.d City - the ones doing robberies, home invasions, running from the cops <br> Once his mom found a bloody hospital gown, from a trip he took to the ER with ""one of his little homeys who got smoked."" Another time she found him curled up crying in the front yard. She thought he was sad because his grandmother had just died: ""I didn't know somebody had shot at him."" One night, the police knocked on their door and said he was involved in an incident in their neighborhood, and his parents, in a bout of tough love, kicked him out for two days. ""And that's a scary thing,"" Lamar says, ""because you might not come back."" <br> After a couple of hours, the mood on Rosecrans starts to shift. An ambulance roars by, sirens blaring. In the middle of the street, a homeless man is shouting at pa**ing cars. Lamar starts to grow uneasy, his eyes glancing at the corners. I ask if everything's OK. ""It's the temperature,"" he says. ""It's uh, raising a little bit."" A few minutes later, one of his friends - who's been cruising back and forth on his bicycle all afternoon, ""patrolling the perimeter"" - calls out, ""Rollers!"" and a few seconds later, two L.A. County sherrif cruisers round the corner. ""There they go,"" Lamar says, as they hit their lights and take off <br> As a teenager, ""the majority of my interactions with police were not good,"" Lamar says. ""There were a few good ones who were actually protecting the community. But then you have ones from the Valley. They never met me in their life, but since I'm a kid in basketball shorts and a white T-shirt, they wanna slam me on the hood of the car. Sixteen years old,"" he says, nodding toward the street. ""Right there by that bus stop. Even if he's not a good kid, that don't give you the right to slam a minor on the ground, or pull a pistol on him."" <br> Lamar says he's had police pull guns on him on two occasions. The first was when he was 17, cruising around Compton with his friend Moose. He says a cop spotted their flashy green Camaro and pulled them over, and when Moose couldn't find his license fast enough, the cop pulled a gun. ""He literally put the beam on my boy's head,"" Lamar recalls. ""I remember driving off in a silence, feeling violated, and him being so angry a tear dropped from his eye."" The story of the second time is murkier: Lamar won't say what he and his friends were up to, only that a cop drew his gun and they ran. ""We was in the wrong,"" he admits. ""But we just kids. It's not worth pulling your gun out over. Especially when we running away."" <br> Friends of his weren't so lucky. Just after midnight on June 13th, 2007, officers from the LAPD's Southeast Division responded to a domestic-violence call on East 120th Street, about five minutes from Lamar's house. There, they found his good friend D.T. allegedly holding a 10-inch knife. According to police, D.T. charged, and an officer opened fire, k**ing him. ""It never really quite added up,"" Lamar says. ""But here's the crazy thing. Normally when we find out somebody got k**ed, the first thing we say is 'Who did it? Where we gotta go?' It's a gang altercation. But this time it was the police - the biggest gang in California. You'll never win against them.""  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> On an otherwise positive song called ""Hiiipower,"" from his 2011 mixtape Section.80, Lamar rapped, ""I got my finger on the motherf**ing pistol/Aim it at a pig, Charlotte's Web is going to miss you."" It's an unsettling line, especially coming from a rapper who often subverts gangster tropes but rarely trafficks in them. ""I was angry,"" he says. ""To be someone with a good heart, and to still be hara**ed as a kid...it took a toll on me. Soon you're just saying, 'f** everything.' That line was me getting those frustrations out. And I'm glad I could get them out with a pen and a paper."" <br> About three years ago, Lamar was flipping through the channels on his tour bus when he saw on the news a report that a 16-year old named Trayvon Martin had been shot to d**h in a Florida subdivision. ""It just put a whole new anger inside me,"" Lamar says. ""It made me remember how I felt. Being hara**ed, my partners being k**ed."" He grabbed a pen and started writing, and within an hour, he had rough verses for a new song, ""The Blacker the Berry"": Coming from the bottom of mankind <br> My hair is nappy, my dick is big <br> My nose is round and wide <br> You hate me, don't you? <br> You hate my people <br> Your plan is to terminate my culture... But as soon as Lamar wrote, he also started thinking about his own time in the streets and ""all the wrong I've done."" So he started writing a new verse, in which he turned the microscope on himself. How can he criticize America for k**ing young black men, he asks, when young black men are often just as good at it? As the song's narrator put it, ""Why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street/When g**ning make me k** a n***a blacker than me?/Hypocrite"" <br> When it was finally released last month, the song sparked a rash of think pieces, with some listeners saying Lamar was ignoring the real problem: the systemic racism that created the conditions for black-on-black crime in the first place. Coupled with a recent Billboard interview in which Lamar seemed to suggest that some of the responsibility for preventing k**ings like that of Michael Brown lay with black people themselves, some fans thought he sounded like a right-wing apologist. The rapper Azealia Banks called his comments ""the dumbest sh** I've ever heard a black man say."" <br> Lamar says he's not an idiot. ""I know the history,"" he says. ""I'm not talking about that. I'm talking from a personal standpoint. I'm talking about g**ning <br> He grew up surrounded by gangs. Some of his close friends were West Side Pirus, a local Blood affiliate, and his mom says her brothers were Compton Crips. One of his uncles did a 15-year stretch for robbery, and another is locked up now for the same; his Uncle Tony, meanwhile, was shot in the head at a burger stand when kendrick was a boy. But Lamar says he was taught that change starts from within. ""My moms always told me: 'How long you gonna play the victim?'"" he says. ""I can say I'm mad and I hate everything, but nothing really changes until I change myself. So no matter how much bullsh** we've been through as a community, I'm strong enough to say f** that, and acknowledge myself and my own struggles."" <br> When Lamar released the new album's first single, ""i,"" last September, many fans weren't sure what to make of it. A blast of pop positivity that samples an Isley Brothers hit recently heard soundtracking a Swiffer commercial, it felt like an odd move for Lamar, who's known for more complex fare. People called it corny, mocked its feel-good, ""Happy""-style chorus (""I love myself!""). ""I know people might think that means I'm conceited or something,"" Lamar says. ""No. It means I'm depressed."" <br> Lamar is sitting in the Santa Monica recording studio where he made much of his new album, dressed in a charcoal sweatsuit and Reeboks. His baseball cap is pulled low over his sprouting braids, and he speaks softly and thoughtfully, with long pauses between sentences <br> ""I've woken up in the morning and felt like sh**,"" he says. ""Feeling guilty. Feeling angry. Feeling regretful. As a kid from Compton, you can get all the success in the world and still question your worth."" <br> Lamar says he intended ""i"" as a ""Keep Ya Head Up""-style message for his friends in the penitentiary. But he also wrote it for himself, to ward off dark thoughts. ""My partner Jason Estrada told me, 'If you don't attack it, it will attack you,'"" Lamar says. ""If you sit around moping, feeling sad and stagnant, it's gonna eat you alive. I had to make that record. It's a reminder. It makes me feel good."" <br> Lamar also points out that the fans who scratched their heads at ""i"" had yet to hear ""u"" - its counterpoint on the album. ""'i' is the answer to 'u,'"" he says. The latter is four and a half minutes of devastating honesty, with Lamar almost sopping over a discordant beat, berating himself about his lack of confidence and calling himself ""a f**ing failure."" It's the sound of a man staring into the mirror and hating what he sees, punctuated by a self-aware hook: ""Loving you is complicated."" <br> ""That was one of the hardest songs I had to write,"" he says. ""There's some very dark moments in there. All my insecurities and selfishness and letdowns. That sh** is depressing as a motherf**er. But it helps, though,"" he says. ""It helps."" <br> Lamar has documented his inner struggles before, most notably on ""Swimming Pools,"" from good kid, which explores his past troubles with alcohol and his family's history of addiction. But once he got successful, he says, things got more difficult, not less. One of his biggest issues was self esteem - accepting that he deserved to be where he was. And some of that came from his discomfort around white people <br> ""I'm going to be 100 percent real with you,"" Lamar says. ""In all my days of schooling, from preschool all the way up to 12th grade, there was not one white person in my cla**. Literally zero."" Before he started touring, he had barely left Compton; when he finally did, the culture shock threw him. ""Imagine only discovering that when you're 25,"" Lamar says. ""You're around people you don't know how to communicate with. You don't speak the same lingo. It brings confusion and insecurity. Questioning how did I get here, what am I doing? That was a cycle I had to break quick. But at the same time, you're excited, because you're in a different environment. The world keeps going outside the neighborhood."" <br> The week good kid was released, Lamar began keeping a diary. ""It really came from the conversations I had with Dre,"" he says. ""Hearing him tell stories about all these moments, and how it went by like that"" - he snaps. ""I didn't want to forget how I was feeling when my album dropped, or when I went back to Compton."" <br> Lamar ended up filling multiple notebooks. ""There's a lot of weird sh** in there,"" he says. ""Lot of drawings, visuals."" Where as good kid was an exercise in millennial nostalgia, To Pimp a bu*terfly is firmly in the present. It's his take on what it means to be young and black in America today - and more specifically, what it means to be Kendrick Lamar, navigating success, expectation and his own self-doubt <br> Musically, the album - at least the half that he's comfortable sharing so far - is adventurous, borrowing from free jazz and 1970s funk. Lamar says he listened to a lot of Miles Davis and Parliament. His producer Mark ""Sounwave"" Spears, who's known Lamar since he was 16, says, ""Every producer I've ever met was sending me stuff - but there was a one-in-a-million chance you could send us a beat that actually fit what we were doing."" Ali says Lamar works synesthetically - ""He talks in colors all the time: 'Make it sound purple.' 'Make it sound light green.'"" <br> But of all the album's colors, the most prominent is black. There are allusions to the entire sweep of African-American history, from the dispora to the cotton fields to the Harlem renaissance to Obama. ""Mortal Man"" (inspired in part by a 2014 trip to South Africa) name-checks leaders from Mandela to MLK all the way back to moses. On ""King Kunta,"" a stomping blast of James Brown funk, he imagines himself as the titular slave from Roots, shouting the punchline ""Everybody wanna cut the legs off him!/Black man taking no losses!"" <br> Hanging over it all, of course, are the tragedies of the past three years: Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice. Says Sounwave, ""To me, the album is perfect for right now. If the world was happy, maybe we'd give you a happy album. But right now, we are not happy."" <br> Lamar - who calls the album ""fearful, honest and unapologetic"" - is coy about what the title means. ""Just putting the word 'pimp' next to 'bu*terfly'..."" he says, then laughs. ""It's a trip. That's something that will be a phrase forever. It'll be taught in college courses - I truly believe that."" I ask if he's the pimp or the bu*terfly, and he just smiles. ""I could be both,"" he says <br> On the last day of February, Lamar and two dozen loved ones are gathered at a $6 million mansion in Calabasas, for a surprise birthday party for Sounwave. The estate belongs to ""Top Dawg"" Tiffeth, part of a group of properties so exclusive they're protected by two security gates, the second presumably to keep out the riff-raff inhabiting the mansions inside the first. NBA star Paul Pierce lives across the street, and multiple Kardashians live around the block. There's probably a million dollars in this driveway,"" says Lamar's tour manager, a friendly dude named retOne, as he surveys the Audis, Benzes and Range Rovers out front <br> Lamar lives down the coast with his longtime girlfriend, Whitney (he has called her his ""best friend""), in a tri-level condo he rents in the South Bay, on the water. He still hasn't splurged on much: So far his biggest purchase is a relatively modest house in the suburbs east of L.A., which he bought for his parents more than a year ago. Top Dawg says that at first his mom didn't want to take it, because it meant giving up their Section 8 status. Kendrick had to rea**ure her: ""It's OK, Mom. We're good."" (""It was hard times, and we've been through a lot,"" says Kenny. ""But like Drake said: 'We started from the bottom, now we're here.'"") <br> In the kitchen, the girls are snacking and chatting, while the guys are in the home theater watching the new Kobe documentary. In the dining room, Lamar is talking to Sounwave and his manager Dave Free, trying to make last-minute changes to the record that's due out in two weeks <br> Eventually, Whitney comes in and rests her hand on Lamar's shoulder. ""They're about the blow out the candles,"" she says. Everyone moves into the kitchen to sing ""Happy Birthday"" to Sounwave, and Lamar stands beside Whitney, his arm around her waist. They look happy. Sounwave is about to blow out the candles when someone tells him to make a wish - but before he can, Lamar jumps in and makes one for him. ""I wish,"" he says, smiling, ""for hot beats!"""

U / For Sale? (God Is Gangsta),"Scene 1: Screams <br> (00:00 - 00:30) <br> With the opening screams the audience can also sense that something is eerie; these sounds are in the original track combined creating a dangerous visual. Then beginning to see Kendrick pouring his heart out in to his liquor in a schizophrenic manner. <br> Scene 2: The Hotel Room <br> (00:30 - 01:26) <br> Hearing the chorus ""Loving you is complicated"" - the image starts to depict that there is an internal struggle going on with him loving himself. The scene is immensely minimalistic and filled with dark lighting, this accompanied by his throne like chair creates for a deep setting for imagery to take a place in the film. <br> Scene 3: Mirror <br> (01:27 - 01:57) <br> The mirror representative of an internal reflection; as the struggle of how he views himself as the words utter ""I ****** tell you, you ****** failure—you ain't no leader!"", the negatively intrinsic views we beginnings to see why he hates himself for the mistakes he has made. <br> Scene 4: Tipsy <br> (01:57 - 02:10) <br> Stumbling all over the place into his throne - blurred visions of the camera shaking around giving us P.O.V (Point of Vision) of what it is like to be overly intoxicated. <br> Scene 5: Room Service <br> The skit from 'u' begins to play before we hear the drunk Lamar entering in the next scene. <br> Dialogue <br> Effect on the Audience <br> (2) Transitional Slide - '8' <br> Scene 6 Part 1: Spinning Bottle <br> (02:37 - 03:42) <br> A very unique and a extremely interesting shot with a spinning bottle in the back ground seemingly to play spin the bottle by himself. <br> Notice this high angle shot focusing down on Lamar with a demonic reflection in the background of the mirror choosing to do it's own thing every now and then. <br> Scene 6 Part 2: Smashed Mirror <br> (03:30 - 03:42) <br> An easily missed technique of a reflection of himself breaking the mirror of reality down, smashing into pieces before the screen goes black into the next slide. <br> (3) Transitional Slide - 'Clearance sale: 100% off' <br> *** PART 2: For Sale *** <br> [Credits - 'For Sale'] <br> Scene 1: The Dunk <br> (03:43 - 07:11) <br> A symbolistic baptism that takes Kendrick under thats meant to cleanse him from his impurities and sins of the night to be reborn again.

Writer At War: 's XXL Cover Story,"Writer At WarKendrick Lamar in his own words.A lot of times in interviews, people ask me things like, ""How does it feel now? What have you bought your mom and your pops and family?"" Nobody ever really asks about what it's like trying to adapt to fame and money and how much of a depression it can make for you. How much of a depression it could put you in knowing that so many kids hang on to your words. I can't make a song like ""i"" without being in that dark place. ""i"" comes from going overseas, going to New York, being in L.A. and hearing kids saying, ""Kendrick, I was gonna k** myself last week. Section.80, good kid, m.A.A.d city saved my life."" Or ""I was gonna k** myself tonight until I came to your show."" <br> I believe that they are telling the truth. At first I wasn't so sure, maybe it was just they were excited to meet me. But then they showed me their wrists and had all these different scars from when they tried to take their lives but failed. Or I look into their eyes and their pupils are dilated and they on all these types of meds and d**, it's a whole different story to me. That's when I learned that while I'm making music for myself, drawing from my own experiences and conflictions and battles within myself, this teenager listens to every word I say. And that's spooky <br> I think one of my biggest battles within myself is embracing leadership. You always grow up and you hate the term ""role model."" You would say, ""I don't wanna be a role model. I don't want none of that."" But in actuality, you are the biggest role model. It's impossible to fight the title of role model. Especially when the type of music I make is so personal. People feel like they can relate to me or that they are me. They feel like they know my whole life story even though we from different worlds. So when I go out and meet them in public, I don't get a response like, ""Kendrick, will you sign this real quick?"" Or, ""I wanna just take this picture with you."" No, they want to have full conversations. I find out that they live their lives by my music and that right there is something <br> [Kendrick Lamar's XXL Cover Story - Second Clip]When I try to soak it all in, that's the only thing that kind've scare me, feel me? Life is sad in general and I'm meeting these different people every day. It kind've snaps me back into reality outside of what I do. Outside of the girls, outside of the cars, the money, it really ain't that important when you meeting somebody that's still in the struggle. These the people that live their lives in dark spaces, every day , you know, and they use my music as some sort of tool to keep going, almost like a Bible, you know? These kids feel like they got nothing to believe in but they see me and say, ""Kendrick, I believe in you. I believe in your music."" And what happens it puts me in some type of space where it's almost like some type of worship or responsibility, but I know it. I can see it <br> Anything I say or do, I don't take back, I don't regret.I think one of my biggest a**ets is not knowing how famous I am. Or even excluding the word, I hate the word ""famous."" I'm aware of it. I know people treat me different because of it. And the more I am aware of that and play into it, the more I become detached from the real world. So it's really about balance. The more somebody opens the door for me and I walk through without acknowledging that they opened the door for me, the more I become separate from others <br> I had a talk with Lauryn Hill and she said, ""Try to completely throw away your ego."" How many times can you throw away an ego, you know? It's tough. It's something we all battle with. I battle with it all the time and the idea of being in all these places—the big spots, all the events, the lights—it's all for your ego. It's all for your own confirmation to be like, okay, I'm somebody. But truthfully, you've always been somebody. You don't need the lights <br> I try to think about that. Also, I like to look at old pictures and think of things from back in the day that kind of draws me back to where I came from. I think a lot of times when artists are in so much of the now, they only think of what's ahead of them, which is cool. But I look at pictures of the small little apartment that I come from in Compton and things like that. And it always trips me out when I get too far out there where I'm missing phone calls or not responding to text messages on time or my peoples is hitting me, my moms is and I can't get back to her. Sometimes you on the go and you forget about those little things <br> It's definitely a gift and a curse when you make music as personal as I make it. Of course you get the kids out there that say that they relate to you and this song saved their lives, and you helped them with their a**ignment for this and that. And then at the same time, your privacy is not respected. And all entertainers go through it, but moreso the ones that make very personal music, because it's not just me you're focusing on now when I'm out in public, but also on individual characters that I'm talking about in my music. So that's a whole other ballgame and it's just something that I've gotta accept <br> When I'm completely drained of inspiration, that's when I'm finished with the project.I think the way it is, the positive aspect of me gaining more listeners and giving them some type of motivation and relatable effect, it's more than running from somebody snapping a picture of my mom's van that was on my album cover, that she actually still has. I'd never think that would happen, but it's happened plenty of times to where she has to hide the van now. She can't drive that thing no more. And she's old school, she wanna drive it. But I never want them to be in this type of world, because not everybody can handle it. I think the average person wouldn't be able to handle the day-to-day. It's a lot of things you gotta deal with. So me doing that, it's just a piece of me. I gotta find balance and try not to really get too frustrated over it <br> I'd be lying to you to say I knew good kid, m.A.A.d city would be as successful as it has been. In the beginning I was very doubtful. Once I was done, the jitters hit me so fast. I was so confident in making it, because I was like, ""This is it, man. Nobody heard this story and if you heard it, you heard it in bits and pieces but I'm finna put it to you in a whole album—from Compton, from the hood, from the streets—it's a whole other perspective and light, I'ma go back and do the skits just like how Biggie and Dre and Snoop and 'Pac did it. And I'ma tell my story."" Then I wrapped up with it and said, ""Man, what's on the radio right now? I don't think they doin' skits and things like that."" I don't know if the people are gonna understand what I'm talkin' about on this album because it's almost like a puzzle pieced together, and albums ain't been created like this in a long time. Albums that actually still reach the ma**es, at least <br> My whole outlook on being signed was to have an actual ma**ive commercial successful album. This is what you think as a kid. You don't know nothing about creative process and things like that. So I didn't know how blessed I was to actually go and make an album that I can create and control 100 percent. When I was done with it, I was like, ""Man, these people believe in me like this? They let me just do this whole thing by myself like this? I don't know. Y'all sure I'm right?"" <br> I was nervous because I didn't think the people would understand it. And I get a call from Pharrell. He said he had a copy of the album and it's amazing. And I was like, that call was right on time because that was when I was feeling super insecure about it. Pharrell said, ""Never feel that way again. When that little negative man come behind your head, always follow your first heart, and that was your first heart, to put the album out like this."" This is his words verbatim, he said, ""Watch what's gonna happen."" <br> I believe in this theory that when you get success and you get fame and money, it makes you be you times ten.When I come up to certain artists, artists that I've always looked up to, and they can recite my records that wasn't the single, that puts me in a space where, okay, this is a person I always respect and to get their respect back was almost like confirmation for me. I always thought confirmation would be having a lot of money, and things I could do for my family <br> Because that was what we was taught when you come from these urban neighborhoods, you was taught that having money was success and that's all you see, all you know. So once I got the money and everything else that comes with it, I felt like I wasn't satisfied. I'm looking around like, this is great security, but I don't even spend it on myself, I spend it on my loved ones. That makes me feel good knowing I can support somebody that's in need. But at the same time, I'm feeling like, okay, what's after this? So what I realized was, my greatest fulfillment of accomplishment was having somebody that I looked up to for so many years and knowing that I put in that same dedication and work and them saying, ""Thank you."" And them being able to recite them lyrics  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> Kendrick Lamar - b**h, Don't k** My Vibe ([Explicit)]I think the first time I played ""b**h, Don't k** My Vibe"" for Andre 3000 was before it came out. I never share my album while I'm creating. I think that the situation with Andre was one of those things where he was in the studio with Dre and Dre was like, ""Play some stuff ."" I can't say no to Dr. Dre. But me creating music, I never really play music for anybody, even people inside the camp because it can almost sway your creative process 100 percent. So along with that, I cut off everything on the radio; I really just duck off from music. Because I'm gonna be influenced and I don't want to be. That has always been my process. I just feel like, it's really the only prized possession that I actually can control, you know? It's selfishness for sure, but it's my selfishness and I own it <br> I know a lot of people that go around and play music to get approval because some are not so confident in the things they do. But with me, personally, I can only speak for myself, this is me. Anything I say or do, I don't take back, I don't regret. That's how I was feeling at the time and that's how y'all gonna get it, and I own it. Love me or hate me, I own it. It is what it is. And that's how I look at it <br> From 13 years old to the time I was 21, I was in a mode of mastering how to be a rapper. Like a rapper's rapper, using my tongue as a sword, a f**in' barbarian. That's all it was about, slaying words. So when I turned 21, 22, somewhere around there, I got into a mode where it became more of a writer aspect for me rather than just being a rapper 'cause this is around the same time where cats weren't putting out mixtapes anymore. They was putting out full bodies of work and wasn't even signed to a major label. So by that time, that's when I started developing and actually constructing my music from a writer's point of view. good kid, m.A.A.d city was probably one of them albums that you could unfold out into a book and read it. And that's how I treat everything. Everything is critical like that from here on out. It's the art of writing <br> So you ask yourself in the midnight hour, 'Who am I? Is this really what I'm supposed to be doing? How did I get here? Why am I doing this? What's my responsibility?'This is more than just music for me. This is actually a piece of me. I'm obsessed with it. And that's how I take it. When I make my music, it comes from a genuine space where I'm already spreading myself wide to the world. So during my process in creating it, that time is for me, personally. That's for my heart, those are my memories that helped me up with these lyrics and get inspiration. That was my memories. Taking those inspirations and going into that booth, that's something that I hold dear <br> When I'm completely drained of inspiration, that's when I'm finished with the project. When I start maybe trying to tamper with things that I shouldn't tamper with, I've already had done, that's when I'm done and I know I've exhausted inspiration. That comes with not wanting to actually rush the process. I always want to put it down to the last idea, and once I'm drawn away from it, that's when I say, okay, let's take all these pieces—they might not even be songs—let's take these pieces and construct it. So what I want to say, and how I want to execute it becomes clear <br> It's the best part because the things that I say on my records—this is another reason why I don't just play records for people—you won't necessarily get it until it's constructed. I know what type of artist I am. I'm not an artist that's gonna give you a single and say, ""This is what my album's gonna sound like, go sell it."" That's not me. I'm just not that artist to give you one or two songs here and there and run with it. Everybody has their own niche. With mine, I just own it, and I know that's exactly what that is. And I wanna keep that lane. I don't want to jump in somebody else's lane and try to do their moves because it may not work for me like it worked for them. So I stay where I feel like I'm inspired <br> What's crazy to me is that I feel the same energy now that I felt before my first album. I know there's lot of pressure for me on this new album but it don't necessarily scare me. It's almost confirmation, like, go in there and challenge yourself just the same way you challenged yourself the first time. Because I remember going to radio stations and them telling me this: ""Dr. Dre had Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent, Eminem, you seen what Eminem did, right? Yeah, uh huh. Kendrick Lamar, he from the West Coast, and Compton, too. Dre from Compton, you see the legacy he left. Yeah, so I hope that album is good. Matter fact, you got the weight on your shoulders right now."" <br> Thank you for that. Let me get in the studio now since you just put the battery in my back <br> [Kendrick Lamar Covers XXL Magazine's Winter 2014 Issue]I thought I was going to win Best Rap Album at the Grammys. I put a lot of work in on my album and the biggest thing for me is knowing that it was basically an underground album. It didn't have big No. 1 records on it and there wasn't really any commercial hits. It was great songs and I think the message behind it reached as many listeners and believers as a super mainstream album. So for me, when you're saying, ""rap,"" that would be my definition of something that deserved an accolade. Yep <br> I found out a lot about myself in these past two years. It's scary. I know more about myself now than any other point of my life. I believe in this theory that when you get success and you get fame and money, it makes you be you times ten. I was a pretty shy and to myself type of person as a kid. And now 15 years later I'm in front of people every day, tens of thousands of people. So that makes me more of a recluse. That makes me not come outside of my world on the outskirts of L.A. and bounce around different places and things like that <br> What I do is for a greater purpose and we all need money and things like that to survive, but the energy around some of these spaces, it can draw you into a crazy place.So you ask yourself in the midnight hour, ""Who am I? Is this really what I'm supposed to be doing? How did I get here? Why am I doing this? What's my responsibility?"" It's a real trippy thing, you feel me? And I think it's something that nobody can understand; only an artist can. Things change for you with success when you get money. I noticed when people started treating me a little bit different, the people that I cared about the most, my close friends and family. The artist don't necessarily change, it's usually the people around them. Their expectations of you can sometimes be out of control. You can do one thing that can trigger something mentally in them that makes them think that you don't care about them or you don't f** with them no more when that's not the case. You're just more focused on what you have to do because it's bigger <br> The moment I start seeing change in people around me, that's when I know something is a little bit different. Then there's tension in the air that I probably can't necessarily deal with at the moment. 'Cause when the industry don't understand me, and the business don't understand me, these are the people I can run to. What happens when I can't run to them? <br> Artists just get paranoid in any situation and circumstance. I'm always paranoid. I'm already a person who thinks a lot; sometimes I may overthink things or think too much. So when you're put into a space where you feel like you can't necessarily trust your close ones, that can do some whole other crazy thing to you psychologically. Seriously. All you got is you and God at the end of the day <br> The hard time for me was probably when I was on the road. It's almost like you go on the road and you're gone for two years. And this place you've known your whole life, these people you've known your whole life, everything is different when you come back. And you feel like, damn, your sanctuary is now on that tour bus. That dirty, stinky, smelly tour bus. And that's one thing, among numerous other things, that have been hard sometimes. To the point where people are pulling for you left and right, where you feel like you don't have control over your own life. Over your own well-being <br> What I do is for a greater purpose and we all need money and things like that to survive, but the energy around some of these spaces, it can draw you into a crazy place. And I've seen and heard some of the greats go out because of it. And I'm saying this right now to let everyone know, it's real and you have to be mentally steady 100 percent in order to keep doing it at a high level and still maintain your sanity"

But I look at pictures of the small little apartment that I come from in Compton and things like that. And it always trips me out when I get too far out there where I'm missing phone calls or not responding to text messages on time or my peoples is hitting me, my moms is and I can't get back to her. Sometimes you on the go and you forget about those little things <br> It's definitely a gift and a curse when you make music as personal as I make it. Of course you get the kids out there that say that they relate to you and this song saved their lives, and you helped them with their a**ignment for this and that. And then at the same time, your privacy is not respected. And all entertainers go through it, but moreso the ones that make very personal music, because it's not just me you're focusing on now when I'm out in public, but also on individual characters that I'm talking about in my music. So that's a whole other ballgame and it's just something that I've gotta accept When I'm completely drained of inspiration, that's when I'm finished with the project. I think the way it is, the positive aspect of me gaining more listeners and giving them some type of motivation and relatable effect, it's more than running from somebody snapping a picture of my mom's van that was on my album cover, that she actually still has. I'd never think that would happen, but it's happened plenty of times to where she has to hide the van now. She can't drive that thing no more. And she's old school, she wanna drive it. But I never want them to be in this type of world, because not everybody can handle it. I think the average person wouldn't be able to handle the day-to-day. It's a lot of things you gotta deal with. So me doing that, it's just a piece of me. I gotta find balance and try not to really get too frustrated over it <br> I'd be lying to you to say I knew good kid, m.A.A.d city would be as successful as it has been. In the beginning I was very doubtful. Once I was done, the jitters hit me so fast. I was so confident in making it, because I was like, “This is it, man. Nobody heard this story and if you heard it, you heard it in bits and pieces but I'm finna put it to you in a whole album—from Compton, from the hood, from the streets—it's a whole other perspective and light, I'ma go back and do the skits just like how Biggie and Dre and Snoop and 'Pac did it. And I'ma tell my story.” Then I wrapped up with it and said, “Man, what's on the radio right now? I don't think they doin' skits and things like that.” I don't know if the people are gonna understand what I'm talkin' about on this album because it's almost like a puzzle pieced together, and albums ain't been created like this in a long time. Albums that actually still reach the ma**es, at least <br> My whole outlook on being signed was to have an actual ma**ive commercial successful album. This is what you think as a kid. You don't know nothing about creative process and things like that. So I didn't know how blessed I was to actually go and make an album that I can create and control 100 percent. When I was done with it, I was like, “Man, these people believe in me like this? They let me just do this whole thing by myself like this? I don't know. Y'all sure I'm right?” <br> I was nervous because I didn't think the people would understand it. And I get a call from Pharrell. He said he had a copy of the album and it's amazing. And I was like, that call was right on time because that was when I was feeling super insecure about it. Pharrell said, “Never feel that way again. When that little negative man come behind your head, always follow your first heart, and that was your first heart, to put the album out like this.” This is his words verbatim, he said, “Watch what's gonna happen.” I believe in this theory that when you get success and you get fame and money, it makes you be you times ten. When I come up to certain artists, artists that I've always looked up to, and they can recite my records that wasn't the single, that puts me in a space where, okay, this is a person I always respect and to get their respect back was almost like confirmation for me. I always thought confirmation would be having a lot of money, and things I could do for my family <br> Because that was what we was taught when you come from these urban neighborhoods, you was taught that having money was success and that's all you see, all you know. So once I got the money and everything else that comes with it, I felt like I wasn't satisfied. I'm looking around like, this is great security, but I don't even spend it on myself, I spend it on my loved ones. That makes me feel good knowing I can support somebody that's in need. But at the same time, I'm feeling like, okay, what's after this? So what I realized was, my greatest fulfillment of accomplishment was having somebody that I looked up to for so many years and knowing that I put in that same dedication and work and them saying, “Thank you.” And them being able to recite them lyrics Kendrick Lamar - b**h, Don't k** My Vibe ([Explicit)] I think the first time I played “b**h, Don't k** My Vibe” for Andre 3000 was before it came out. I never share my album while I'm creating. I think that the situation with Andre was one of those things where he was in the studio with Dre and Dre was like, “Play some stuff .” I can't say no to Dr. Dre. But me creating music, I never really play music for anybody, even people inside the camp because it can almost sway your creative process 100 percent. So along with that, I cut off everything on the radio; I really just duck off from music. Because I'm gonna be influenced and I don't want to be. That has always been my process. I just feel like, it's really the only prized possession that I actually can control, you know? It's selfishness for sure, but it's my selfishness and I own it  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> I know a lot of people that go around and play music to get approval because some are not so confident in the things they do. But with me, personally, I can only speak for myself, this is me. Anything I say or do, I don't take back, I don't regret. That's how I was feeling at the time and that's how y'all gonna get it, and I own it. Love me or hate me, I own it. It is what it is. And that's how I look at it From 13 years old to the time I was 21, I was in a mode of mastering how to be a rapper. Like a rapper's rapper, using my tongue as a sword, a f**in' barbarian. That's all it was about, slaying words. So when I turned 21, 22, somewhere around there, I got into a mode where it became more of a writer aspect for me rather than just being a rapper 'cause this is around the same time where cats weren't putting out mixtapes anymore. They was putting out full bodies of work and wasn't even signed to a major label. So by that time, that's when I started developing and actually constructing my music from a writer's point of view. good kid, m.A.A.d city was probably one of them albums that you could unfold out into a book and read it. And that's how I treat everything. Everything is critical like that from here on out. It's the art of writing So you ask yourself in the midnight hour, ‘Who am I? Is this really what I'm supposed to be doing? How did I get here? Why am I doing this? What's my responsibility?' This is more than just music for me. This is actually a piece of me. I'm obsessed with it. And that's how I take it. When I make my music, it comes from a genuine space where I'm already spreading myself wide to the world. So during my process in creating it, that time is for me, personally. That's for my heart, those are my memories that helped me up with these lyrics and get inspiration. That was my memories. Taking those inspirations and going into that booth, that's something that I hold dear <br> When I'm completely drained of inspiration, that's when I'm finished with the project. When I start maybe trying to tamper with things that I shouldn't tamper with, I've already had done, that's when I'm done and I know I've exhausted inspiration. That comes with not wanting to actually rush the process. I always want to put it down to the last idea, and once I'm drawn away from it, that's when I say, okay, let's take all these pieces—they might not even be songs—let's take these pieces and construct it. So what I want to say, and how I want to execute it becomes clear <br> It's the best part because the things that I say on my records—this is another reason why I don't just play records for people—you won't necessarily get it until it's constructed. I know what type of artist I am. I'm not an artist that's gonna give you a single and say, “This is what my album's gonna sound like, go sell it.” That's not me. I'm just not that artist to give you one or two songs here and there and run with it. Everybody has their own niche. With mine, I just own it, and I know that's exactly what that is. And I wanna keep that lane. I don't want to jump in somebody else's lane and try to do their moves because it may not work for me like it worked for them. So I stay where I feel like I'm inspired <br> What's crazy to me is that I feel the same energy now that I felt before my first album. I know there's lot of pressure for me on this new album but it don't necessarily scare me. It's almost confirmation, like, go in there and challenge yourself just the same way you challenged yourself the first time. Because I remember going to radio stations and them telling me this: “Dr. Dre had Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent, Eminem, you seen what Eminem did, right? Yeah, uh huh. Kendrick Lamar, he from the West Coast, and Compton, too. Dre from Compton, you see the legacy he left. Yeah, so I hope that album is good. Matter fact, you got the weight on your shoulders right now.” <br> Thank you for that. Let me get in the studio now since you just put the battery in my back [Kendrick Lamar Covers XXL Magazine's Winter 2014 Issue] I thought I was going to win Best Rap Album at the Grammys. I put a lot of work in on my album and the biggest thing for me is knowing that it was basically an underground album. It didn't have big No. 1 records on it and there wasn't really any commercial hits. It was great songs and I think the message behind it reached as many listeners and believers as a super mainstream album. So for me, when you're saying, “rap,” that would be my definition of something that deserved an accolade. Yep <br> I found out a lot about myself in these past two years. It's scary. I know more about myself now than any other point of my life. I believe in this theory that when you get success and you get fame and money, it makes you be you times ten. I was a pretty shy and to myself type of person as a kid. And now 15 years later I'm in front of people every day, tens of thousands of people. So that makes me more of a recluse. That makes me not come outside of my world on the outskirts of L.A. and bounce around different places and things like that What I do is for a greater purpose and we all need money and things like that to survive, but the energy around some of these spaces, it can draw you into a crazy place. So you ask yourself in the midnight hour, “Who am I? Is this really what I'm supposed to be doing? How did I get here? Why am I doing this? What's my responsibility?” It's a real trippy thing, you feel me? And I think it's something that nobody can understand; only an artist can. Things change for you with success when you get money. I noticed when people started treating me a little bit different, the people that I cared about the most, my close friends and family. The artist don't necessarily change, it's usually the people around them. Their expectations of you can sometimes be out of control. You can do one thing that can trigger something mentally in them that makes them think that you don't care about them or you don't f** with them no more when that's not the case. You're just more focused on what you have to do because it's bigger The moment I start seeing change in people around me, that's when I know something is a little bit different. Then there's tension in the air that I probably can't necessarily deal with at the moment. 'Cause when the industry don't understand me, and the business don't understand me, these are the people I can run to. What happens when I can't run to them? <br> Artists just get paranoid in any situation and circumstance. I'm always paranoid. I'm already a person who thinks a lot; sometimes I may overthink things or think too much. So when you're put into a space where you feel like you can't necessarily trust your close ones, that can do some whole other crazy thing to you psychologically. Seriously. All you got is you and God at the end of the day <br> The hard time for me was probably when I was on the road. It's almost like you go on the road and you're gone for two years. And this place you've known your whole life, these people you've known your whole life, everything is different when you come back. And you feel like, damn, your sanctuary is now on that tour bus. That dirty, stinky, smelly tour bus. And that's one thing, among numerous other things, that have been hard sometimes. To the point where people are pulling for you left and right, where you feel like you don't have control over your own life. Over your own well-being <br> What I do is for a greater purpose and we all need money and things like that to survive, but the energy around some of these spaces, it can draw you into a crazy place. And I've seen and heard some of the greats go out because of it. And I'm saying this right now to let everyone know, it's real and you have to be mentally steady 100 percent in order to keep doing it at a high level and still maintain your sanity"

XXL Oct/Nov 2013 Cover Story,"There's a new crew taking over hip-hop, and everybody's trying to be down. I try to stay in my own little bubble and not think about how people view me, 'cause if you do that, it's very quick that you can go crazy. Kendrick Lamar: That's crazy. <br> XXL: What? <br> KL: TMZ. <br> XXL: How did you break into that world? You're like a little backpack rapper, and then all of a sudden TMZ cares about what you're doing. <br> KL: That world is The Matrix. I don't understand that world—that's The Matrix. <br> XXL: Is it really like they say, that it happens fast? Even though you're moving real slow and then— <br> KL: Yeah, that's very true. That's very true. It definitely happens fast, but not fast in the sense, saying you didn't put in the work—I've been doing this for ten years—but when that light beams on you, it happens fast from an aspect where you're doing so much every day [that] you're not really aware of the attention that you're getting, 'cause you're doing interviews, you do a show, then you do a studio, it's just a constant, daily plan, so you can't look at yourself. You can't be in the crowd looking at yourself on stage, you know. I can only look in the mirror and know I'm Kendrick, and see that same little boy I seen seven years [ago], but I can't see what everyone else sees. So more and more, I'm really unfazed by it as more and more success is hitting me and I'm not really sure [about it all]. It's a tricky thing, for sure.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> XXL: What's your day-to-day been like for the past few months? Has it been mostly touring and interviews? Have you back in the studio? Do you write often? Where are you at, as an artist? <br> KL: I've been on the road for the most part. But at the same time I gotta stay creative, I gotta stay writing—I'm usually writing every day. I can't miss a day without writing, whether it's a line, a verse, or an idea. I always have to have that creative flow going. <br> XXL: When you say you write, what's your writing process like? Are you writing or are you just thinking sh** in your mind? <br> KL: The process for my first album, my debut album, and even music prior to that, it's always been like 50/50. I have some songs where I just went in the booth and just got the thoughts off and I didn't want to feel like I was confined with a sheet of paper. Some records, I may sit with it and have scraps of napkins everywhere, and papers everywhere scattered, then [I'm] piecing up them ideas together and putting them to songs.

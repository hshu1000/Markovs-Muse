A Burning Hill,Today I will wear my white bu*ton-down <br> I'm tired of wanting more <br> I think I'm finally worn <br> For you have a way of promising things <br> And I've been a forest fire <br> I am a forest fire <br> And I am the fire and I am the forest <br> And I am a witness watching it <br> I stand in a valley watching it  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> And you are not there at all <br> So today I will wear my white bu*ton-down <br> I can at least be neat <br> Walk out and be seen as clean <br> And I'll go to work and I'll go to sleep <br> And I'll love the littler things <br> I'll love some littler things
A Loving Feeling,What do you do with a loving feeling <br> If the loving feeling makes you all alone? <br> What do you do with a loving feeling <br> If they only love you when you're all alone? <br> Holding hands under the table <br> Meeting up in your bedroom <br> Making love to other people <br> Telling each other it's all good <br> Kisses like pink cotton candy <br> Talking to everyone but me <br> I'm staying up late just in case you come up and ask to leave with me  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> What do you do with a loving feeling <br> If the loving feeling makes you all alone? <br> What do you do with a loving feeling <br> If they only love you when you're all alone? <br> What do you do with a loving feeling <br> If the loving feeling makes you all alone? <br> What do you do with a loving feeling <br> If they only love you when you're all alone? <br> You only love me when we're all alone
